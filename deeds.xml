The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song was written many long years ago and tells the tale of a Shield-maiden of Rohan. While the Shield-maidens of Rohan were rarely called to war, they were nevertheless as well-trained and versed in the arts of battle as their male counterparts. This book tells the tale of one such Maiden caught in unexpected battle, who in striving to defend her Lord against a great onslaught, sang out in clearest tones a stirring song of war as she fought. Such was the power of her voice that even the Orcs whom she faced saw her not as a frail woman, but as a great warrior to be feared.&#10;&#10;Alas, you have no idea how the story ends and several other details beside seem to be missing from this copy of the book, which has been damaged by time and neglect. Perhaps there is someone at Rivendell who would be able to make use of it." objectives="A Shield-maiden's Song, Page 1&#10;This is the title page of the book.

The text ends as she charges to the fore of the battle, placing herself between the enemy and one of her kinsmen.&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song, Page 12&#10;This passage opens with the heroine of the poem shielding her kinsman from a mob of Orcs, relentlessly battling the foul horde regardless of her own life. While she did not come through unscathed, in the end her skill and courage brought her through to victory.&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song, Page 15&#10;This passage tells how, because of her many feats of honour and glory, the shield-maiden was elevated to become the King of the Mark's personal guard.&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song, Page 19&#10;This passage tells how the foes of Rohan learned to fear the shield-maiden, for she seemed invulnerable in their eyes. Her renown drew all enemies upon her whenever she took to the field.&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song, Page 25&#10;The story ends with the death of the shield-maiden. Though she perished, her king lived and songs of her loyalty and courage were ever sung in the Golden Hall on feast days thereafter.&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song, Page 26&#10;The last page of the text contains commentary by the scholar who recorded the poem. He explains how A Shield-maiden's Song demonstrates the true nature of the guardian: To defend those in need, regardless of her own life. In the end, the guardian will win all renown.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;This journal was written by a hunter who seems to have spent much of his time alone somewhere on the western borders of Mirkwood across the Misty Mountains, where few Men live and goblins present a frequent threat. With no allies to rely upon and always outnumbered, he discovered the value of uncertainty and fear as a weapon to keep his pursuers off balance as he strove to survive in that rugged country. Having no-one to talk to, it seems that he chose to create a record of his life and experiences.&#10;&#10;This journal is badly weathered and torn -- perhaps by the self-same goblins whom the hunter claims to have frequently out-witted -- and several key passages are missing. Another hunter of renown might be able to shed some light on this unusual book. Legolas of Mirkwood is said to be in Eriador on a mission of some import." objectives="A Shot in the Dark, page 5&#10;This page contains entries from some of the hunter's early days. His skills were lacking, and oft he found himself in dire straits only to escape by the merest of chances.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 10&#10;This text shows how the hunter finally learned how to move nearly as silently as an Elf, but while he could use his abilities to hide from danger, he could not yet draw his bow without a small noise. That was often enough to warn his prey of his presence.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 14&#10;This passage says little of interest. It is mostly a description of his attempts to stalk a lone boar he came upon in the forest.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 16&#10;This page relates how the hunter's failed attempt to stalk a wild boar led him into trouble with a band of goblins. The only good that came of the encounter was a firm resolve to master his skills.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 19&#10;This page tells of the hunter's self-training in the heart of Mirkwood, east of the Misty Mountains. When he at last deemed himself ready, he returned to the forests of Eriador to hunt the goblins who had driven him from his home.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 22&#10;This page recounts the hunter's first encounter with the goblins after returning to Eriador. He came upon the trail of a goblin scouting-party and hunted them back to their encampment. The page ends there.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 23&#10;This page tells how, using his newly-trained skills, the hunter slew an entire encampment of goblins without ever being found by them. His skill with a bow and his penchant for stalking the shadows earned him renown among Elven minstrels.&#10;A Shot in the Dark, page 25&#10;The final entry of this journal appears to be instruction on how he trained himself to master the arts of fear and confusion. The entry is unfinished, but it may be of use to a skilled hunter.">

You and Horn, a man of Rohan in service at Stangard, brought her to the Elves for healing. Galadriel saved her life, but the Lady of Lórien refused to speak further of what awaits you.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 7: A Fellowship Endangered'&#10;You tracked the Fellowship of the Ring south along Anduin to Parth Galen and the Falls of Rauros, where you encountered signs that they were set upon by foes. Two hobbits, most likely Frodo Baggins and his servant Samwise Gamgee, crossed the river and continued on their quest. The surviving members of the company crossed into Rohan, and if you are to find them and help them, you will need war-steeds of your own.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 8: Into the Riddermark'&#10;You have journeyed into the Riddermark, helping the people of East Rohan and tracking the remnants of the Fellowship of the Ring. Your travels brought you through the Wold, the Norcrofts, and finally the Entwash Vale, where Nona vanished and Horn realized his feelings for her.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 9: The Third Marshal'&#10;You encountered Éomer, the nephew of the King and Third Marshal of the Riddermark, and travelled with him through the Entwash Vale and the Sutcrofts. When he brought you before the King, however, you witnessed the extent of Saruman's hold on King Théoden. The King ordered Éomer imprisoned and banished you, ordering you never to cross the Entwash under pain of death.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 10: Snows of Wildermore'&#10;You journeyed to the land of Wildermore, beset by unnatural winter and endangered by pawns of the Wizard Saruman, and did what you could for its people.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 11: The Golden Hall'&#10;You returned to Edoras and witnessed the restoration of Théoden by Gandalf. You also helped Éowyn prepare for the evacuation of the city, while the King and his riders departed for Isengard, and war.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 12: War in the Westemnet'&#10;You journeyed throughout West Rohan, aiding its people as they prepare to face the perils of war.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 13: Helm's Deep'&#10;You stood with the Rohirrim at the fortress of the Hornburg, in Helm's Deep, and survived the long night of battle with Saruman's armies. When dawn came, impossibly, Théoden and his people looked out over the Deep in victory.&#10;&#10;Complete 'Volume III Book 14: The Waters of Isengard'&#10;The Grey Company has completed its mission to find Aragorn, and the threat of Saruman has been ended.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Written some two hundred years ago, &quot;Bullroarer's Boy&quot; was a fanciful journal kept by Haldemar Took, one of the younger sons of Bandobras Took. After the Battle of Greenfields, Haldemar became a Warden of the Shire, and told many Tall (or rather short) Tales of adventures beyond the Bounds, many of them humorous accounts of battle against goblins and trolls and other beasts, some wholly imagined. Though much of the book is whimsy, there is truth at the core that any Warden would value. Sadly, the three known copies of the book were all stolen, suspiciously, within a week of one another nearly a century ago." objectives="Bullroarer's Boy, page 4&#10;Here is a page from the first chapter, which details the early days of Haldemar Took. He was born hardy and so covered in such a fine, thick coat of fur that his father Bandobras mistook him for a badger.&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 7&#10;'A most persnichety hobbit was Haldemar: only the most fine and flexible job would suit him, for in him was not the heart of a common baker or smithy. The fierceness of his father dwelled in him also, thus he took up what weapons he could find and set on the path to becoming a great Warden.'&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 10&#10;'A great murder of crebain landed in the willows of Tookland and thus began a most frightful assault on the peace of the borough. They pecked and devoured the crops and made such a racket that all but a brave few stopped their ears with cotton and went to visit relatives far away in Waymeet and Hobbiton. Haldemar, staying behind, singlehandedly drove off the birds in a fright after killing two at once with a single stone's throw.'&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 12&#10;This page details Haldemar's first foray into the Wild, an adventure as grand as any you would hear of a hobbit from the Shire, save for a select few especially legendary excursions....&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 17&#10;Here Haldemar is said to have driven a goblin-prince to madness by mocking him with his ever-changing strategies, feigning his intentions ever with his skilful diversity.&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 21&#10;Written here is the horrific tale of the Great Honey Famine of 2759, lasting a fortnight and a day. Great slavering bears took the hives of Tookland captive, and the wretched hobbits of Tuckborough were forced to have their bread, butter and tea without any honey at all. Haldemar, returning from a journey, was able to cleverly lure them off with his diversionary tactics upon his return home.&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 25&#10;This leaf describes the weapons chosen by Haldemar, and the thick armour he wore, raising quite a scandal among the less adventurous hobbits who beheld him. It is said that he wore his armour, arms, and travelling cloak always, even while strolling in the very heart of the shire, as a warning to other hobbits not to grow too soft and cosy, lest danger return again.&#10;Bullroarer's Boy, page 33&#10;The tale of Haldemar Took ends with the besting of the fabled Giant in the Midgewater Marshes, after which our hero retired as a Marchwarden and adopted instead the serious profession sampling and tasting beers, wines, and vittles.">

Though this mine was believed to be mostly played out by the time of the Fall of Khazad-dûm, the dwarves of the expedition hope to find some remaining veins to prove the value of this dangerous foray and to draw more of their brethren from abroad to aid them in reclaiming their ancient home.&#10;Find Harâzgund 17.6S/116.9W (The Water-works)&#10;The gateway of Harâzgund leads to the source of one of the greatest waterways in all of Khazad-dûm.

Now the water lies here unmoving, flooding the deeps in great, stagnant pools.&#10;Find the Forges of Khazad-dûm 17.0S/109.8W (The Flaming Deeps)&#10;The Forges of Khazad-dûm were without rival, greatest of all forges in the Third Age of Middle-earth.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain was a series of annals kept by the Rangers of the North, recording the wisdom of every chief from Aranarth, the first, all the way to Arador. It has much to say of the early days of the Rangers, when they were at their most scattered after the fall of Arnor. It was lost, however, when Arador was slain by trolls in the wilds of the Ettenmoors. It is thought that he buried it before the battle that ended in his death, but none knew where. A new annal was kep beginning with his son, Arathorn II, but all the wisdom of the preceding chieftains vanished, presumably forever." objectives="Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 3&#10;This page tells a fragment of the achievements of Arassuil, detailing his dealings with the Orcs of the Misty Mountains as they poured from the hills to harry the surrounding lands. Arassuil led the Dúnedain thither to ally with the sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, and together they quelled the offence.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 12&#10;Here the history states that Arassuil helped Fréalaf, King of Rohan, to drive Wulf the Usurper out of Edoras. His doughty skill lent great aid to the fair Men of Rohan, and he rode with the Éorlingas as kin whither he wished.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 13&#10;This leaf tells of Arathorn I, who fought alongside the dwarves in the Battle of Nanduhirion before East Gate of Moria. The dwarves entered battle here to avenge the death of Thrór by Azog.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 17&#10;Arathorn I went valiantly with the Dúnedain to lend assistance to the Éorlings when Orcs from the north attacked Rohan. This war went on for sixty-four years, and Arathorn died ere the end, in 2848.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 18&#10;On this page is tell of Argonui, a Ranger and Warden of great renown. He led his kin to the aid of the White Council in a time of one of their most dangerous deeds: the exile of the Necromancer from Dol Guldur. This Necromancer turned out to be none other than Sauron himself.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 23&#10;It is written here that Argonui walked for a time in Ithilien in Gondor, one of the last fair places near Mordor. There he was when the uruks of Mordor beseiged the woods aiming to drive out the Wardens of Ithilien once and for all, but Argonui helped to establish the refuge of Henneth Annún, so well hidden that it remains a haven to this day.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 29&#10;This page tells of Arador, grandsire of Aragorn. He long watched the mountains of Angmar against the return of the Angmarim, until he was called away to begin his time as the chieftan of the Dúnedain.&#10;Chieftains of the Dúnedain, page 32&#10;Alas, this text was written after Arador's time, and the loose leaf seems to be stuck in the book as an afterthought before it was hidden. Arador's reign was short, indeed only spanning eighteen years. His hunting party was beset by Hill-trolls in the Ettenmoors, and he was slain before his time. Too often do Wardens meet this end.">

It is no different here in the depths of Moria, and no one queen has risen dominant above the others for long. Whether the arrival of the dwarves will prove a strong enough goad to unite them has yet to be seen.&#10;Find Gríshurbhrum 3.0S/100.8W (Durin's Way)&#10;This high perch has long been used by merrevail queens to challenge each other to battles of ascendance and rule over each other's broods. So much evil blood has been spilled here over centuries of darkness that its stains may never be washed from the stone.&#10;Find Khulturg 2.7S/100.1W (Durin's Way)&#10;This deep, black pool once served the dwarves of Moria as a place for silent contemplation of the depths. Now it lies polluted and the air is rent by the raucous cries of the merrevail flocks. There is no peace to be found here now.&#10;Find Dâr-rukh 4.1S/100.8W (Durin's Way)&#10;The stone cages of Dar-rukh serve as larders for the merrevail.

This error he compounded in a fruitless quest for vengeance, eventually trapping his spirit within the confines of the barrow of Goetham upon his death.&#10;&#10;In time, he was discovered by the Gaunt-man Fergandir and twisted to the service of Angmar in his anguish, which can be heard howling up through the bones of the earth on the darkest, moonless nights.&#10;&#10;Or so the story is told to the children of Bree-land around their fireplaces on dark and windy nights....&#10;Defeat Marrow in the barrow of Haudh Methernil 31.5S/55.5W (Northern Barrow-downs)&#10;The kergrim Marrow has been drawn to the darkness and evil lurking within Haudh Methernil, where he preys upon the dead as willingly as he does upon the living who dare to tread within.&#10;Defeat Gwigon in the barrow of Taradan 30.9S/55.0W (Northern Barrow-downs)&#10;No one can say from what evil brood Gwigon hatched, nor when this evil thing came to the barrow of Taradan, but her brood now scuttles silently through its myriad halls, searching for any scrap of life and sustenance upon which to feed.">

The statue was untouched by the Orcs, but its sad countenance witnessed a great deal of pain and death on the grass below.&#10;Find the south-west corner of Minas Elendúr&#10;The south-west corner in Minas Elendur contains two platforms of raised steps and a great deal of debris. None of the columns reach the ceiling any longer, and this section of the ruins feels particularly unstable.&#10;Find the enclosed porch in Minas Elendúr&#10;This enclosed porch looks out over one of Minas Elendur's several large courtyards. Valuables were left here, overlooked by the forces of evil that hunted the inhabitants here when war came to Eregion.&#10;Find the circular courtyard in Minas Elendúr&#10;This courtyard, once a place of reflection for the Elves that lived in Minas Elendur, is now home only to bears driven mad with hunger. From above, the windows of an enclosed porch look out over the crumbling stones.&#10;Find the south-east corner in Minas Elendúr&#10;The pillars of this room in the south-east corner of Minas Elendúr are covered with ivy and crawling vines. The corners are shrouded in darkness as so much of these ruins are.&#10;Find the south-east aisle in Minas Elendúr&#10;This aisle, open to the skies of Eregion, was once the home of much greenery. Now only a few trees and bushes stand atop a raised platform here. This place is a junction of sorts, and passages lead away in three directions.&#10;Find the isolated chamber in Minas Elendúr&#10;This isolated chamber, reachable only by stairs from Delotham, was one of the last places held by the Elves of Minas Elendúr when war game to Eregion. Their sad end left a mark on this grim chamber that time has not erased.&#10;Find the dimly-lit pillared room in Minas Elendúr&#10;Pillars still reach to the ceiling in this dimly-lit room, despite the debris and fallen stones piled in the corners.&#10;Find the windowed chamber in Minas Elendúr&#10;From this windowed chamber, the Elves that lived in this place watched as the forces of evil marauded through Minas Elendúr, slaying its meagre defenders. This elevated chamber bears the mark of their grief and despair, waiting as they did for the end to come.&#10;Find the room of doors in Minas Elendúr&#10;After the first assault of Orcs attacked Minas Elendúr, many of the Elves that remained within were scattered and had to fend for themselves. They made their way through the maze-like interior, avoiding patrolling Orcs wherever they could. Rooms such as this one enabled many of the Elves to escape from their pursuers, but not all were successful.&#10;Find the room of dread in Minas Elendúr&#10;This room has been marked by terrible evil, and the very stones cry out against the stain. What can have happened in this place to leave such torment in its wake?&#10;Find the northern room in Minas Elendúr&#10;Three passages lead away from the northernmost room in Minas Elendúr, passages down which the heavy tramp of Orc-feet carried even on the still air when war came to Eregion.&#10;Find the large balcony in Minas Elendúr&#10;This upper balcony overlooks a courtyard in the southern area of Minas Elendúr and is home to treasure forgotten -- or ignored -- by the Orcs.&#10;Find the south-west corner of Delotham&#10;Part of the wall has crumbled away in this south-west corner of Delotham, the basement of Minas Elendúr. It is patrolled now by Ninkoth uruks, their heavy footfalls bringing to mind that of the Orcs that stalked these passages when war came to Eregion.&#10;Find the illuminated room in Delotham&#10;Stone-lizards scamper along the floor of this chamber in Delotham, perhaps drawn by the illumination that breaks through the ceiling from above.&#10;Find the rubble-filled room in Delotham&#10;Treasure can be found among the fallen rocks and debris of this junction in Delotham, where long ago Elves fought to defend their home from attack by the forces of evil.&#10;Find the buried room in Delotham&#10;This chamber, accessible only by stairs from Minas Elendúr, served as a final hiding-place for the Elves here when the Orcs came for them. The Enemy has more than just Orcs in his service, and this chamber still bears the mark of the evil that happened between these buried walls.&#10;Find the four-corridor junction in Delotham&#10;A diverse range of creatures make their home now in Delotham: stone-lizards and insects that have come to this place from hidden cracks within Khazad-dûm. The four passages that meet here ensure that it once saw much foot traffic in time of peace and much hurried panic in time of war.&#10;Find the illuminated bend in Delotham&#10;This bend is illuminated by shafts of light from above, one of the few places within Delotham where shadow does not lie heavily upon the stones.&#10;Find the central chamber in Delotham&#10;This chamber within Delotham is centrally-located, but must see very little in the way of explorers. Bats nest here in the dark corners, and treasure too can be found if the shadowy curtain is drawn aside.&#10;Find the collapsed corner in Delotham&#10;This corner in the western area of Delotham is partially collapsed, as the ravages of time buckled the south wall. As the Orcs spread throughout Minas Elendúr and Delotham in search of survivors of the initial assault, Elves came to hide wherever they could stay ahead of the marching footfall of the Orcs. This corner may once have sheltered such an Elf, though what became of any who tried to stay here is unknown and unknowable.&#10;Find the sunken chamber in Delotham&#10;This sunken chamber, hidden for some days following the initial assault of the Orcs, is where the last three Elves of Minas Elendúr made their stand against the Enemy, when war came to Eregion. No tales tell how long they may have held out against the overwhelming force of the Orcs, but it is the tradition of Elrond of Rivendell to say that they held out until the end -- and beyond it -- and only when those who had escaped were safely out of Eregion did these last three fall.&#10;Find the northern chamber in Delotham&#10;The northernmost room of Delotham was built a distance from the other rooms, but none can say for what purpose it may have been. It seems to have not been for defensive reasons, for time alone is responsible for the decay in this chamber, and the war that came to Eregion and destroyed the Elves of Minas Elendúr seems to have left this chamber alone.">

Could they be true?" objectives="Find the following Flowers:&#10;Use Rhosthorn's Flower 32.0S/61.0W (Old Forest)&#10;You have found the flower of Rhosthon. It is believed that she was once an Entwife who stood with vigilance over her gardens. None could approach without her knowledge, and those with evil intent would feel her gaze upon them and flee.&#10;&#10;She passed into the Old Forest many long years ago and became part of the forest, granting her keen senses to the trees and creatures herein that evil might not approach unseen, for those were dark days and few places remained that were untouched by the power of Sauron.&#10;&#10;The flowers are said to mark the place where she disappeared into the forest and seem to have been tended by someone.&#10;Use Neldorlas' Flower 30.6S/57.3W (Old Forest)&#10;You have discovered the flower of Neldorlas, an Entwife of old. It was she who was foremost in the arts of nurturing the young, that they might achieve their potential in the fullness of time.&#10;&#10;Not one seed did she plant, nor youthful mind touch that did not come to fruition, unless it was struck down by unfortunate fate. Such was her understanding of the arts of cultivation and teaching.&#10;&#10;As with her sisters, she chose to become a part of the Old Forest, that it might endure the encroachment of darkness and evil throughout the years. So the folk tales say, anyway.&#10;Use Dorollin's Flower 34.2S/60.1W (Old Forest)&#10;The flower you found marks the place where the Entwife Dorollin passed into the Old Forest, perhaps forever.&#10;&#10;She was among the largest of her kind, taller than any other, for the essence of all that grows was at the core of her nature. Her gardens were sprawling places wrapped in great vines, and enormous trees cast their shade upon acres of fertile ground.&#10;&#10;She gave herself to the Old Forest to ensure that it would grow great enough to protect itself from the incursion of evil such as Orcs and thoughtless Men.&#10;&#10;Some folk say that one day they will awaken and emerge from the forest - but no one knows when that might be.&#10;Use Cordofoneth's Flower 32.6S/59.3W (Old Forest)&#10;You discovered Cordofoneth's flower -- said to be one of eight Entwife sisters. Among her kin, she held most dear her affection for all living things.&#10;&#10;It was this affection that she lent the Old Forest when she passed into its depths long ago, that all manner of living things might find shelter within its bounds. The flower you have found marks the place where she entered the forest, and she has not been seen since.&#10;&#10;Alas, the Old Forest has oft been harmed by Men or intruded upon by darker powers, and so it is said that her heart lies muted, and she sleeps more deeply than her sisters. Perhaps she is awaiting the day when this world might become a place of lighter moods and the love of life is not so easily betrayed by axe or fire.&#10;Use Lenhwest's Flower 33.3S/57.5W (Old Forest)&#10;You have discovered the flower of Lenhwest. She was believed to be an Entwife known for her unquenchable passions. She could love as no other, but fury and despair were also her constant companions.&#10;&#10;Amongst her sisters, she was the first to give herself to the forest, swept by her own emotions to ensure its survival during the trials of those dark years. Her presence is strongly felt in these woods still.&#10;&#10;It is for fear of Lenhwest's tempestuous anger that folk walk with care in the Old Forest, for many believe that if her heart turns against you, it is unlikely you will ever emerge from it again!&#10;Use Silloth's Flower 35.2S/56.9W (Old Forest)&#10;You have found Silloth's flower. She was said to have been a wonderous spirit - her heart was unbowed even during the ancient war that drove the Entwife sisters here, for mirth and frivolity ever followed in her wake, and her gardens were believed to be places where even the weariest of mortals could bring themselves to smile and laugh.&#10;&#10;Among the Elves she was particularly beloved, and of those who remember her they fear they may never again hear the sound of her laughter beneath the boughs of ancient trees.&#10;Use Braiglad's Flower 32.2S/58.4W (Old Forest)&#10;The flower of Braiglad is seen as a warning by superstitious folk who would dare the depths of the Old Forest. She was an Entwife unusual amongst her sisters, for she was a wild and capricious being. Her gardens were populated by untamed beasts, and even the most delicate flowers within them were adorned with sharp thorns.&#10;&#10;Braiglad rarely spoke with mortals, preferring the wild places of the forest, and in time she gave herself to the forest to protect it from the dark powers.&#10;&#10;There are those who say her spirit is strongest when aroused by wild and dangerous times such as these.&#10;Use Merillif's Flower 35.3S/58.3W (Old Forest)&#10;The tale of Merillif's flower often brings tears to those who hear it. Of the eight Entwives who came to the Old Forest, she was the most beautiful and the most beloved of all.&#10;&#10;Her gardens shone with a brilliance of colour that even the finest artisans of the Firstborn would regard with envy. Her jewels were said to be the petals of flowers, and while they would last but a short season -- unlike the gems of the Noldor which are forever -- their beauty far surpassed that of any object carved of stone or crystal. This passing beauty was such that it endured no greed, and so the vanity of evil hearts could neither possess nor endure it.&#10;&#10;Those who are fond of the story say that she will awaken some day when beauty can again be shared amongst all the creatures of Arda without fear of despoilment or jealous vanity.">

The goblins themselves may not know all the ways, for the deepest passages extend far into the heart of the Misty Mountains where dark and unseen terrors lie, and the goblins will not brave these passages unless driven or enraged." objectives="Find War Steadings&#10;The War Steading serves as a large barracks for Goblin-town, where their soldiers and skirmishers gather and prepare for raids upon the villages to either side of the Mountains. Mostly, they descend through the passages to the east to fall upon smaller and more weakly defended settlements of Men which border the Mirkwood, but on occasion, when their strength grows, they have been known to raid Elf-settlements on the edges of Rivendell's domain – though these over-bold assaults generally turn out badly for the goblins, and few return.&#10;Find Thundergrot&#10;The Thundergrot is aptly named for the enormous booming sounds that echo through the surrounding caves and passages. This thunder is produced by massive drums carried by Cave-troll Drummers, who are bred and enslaved by the goblins and employed when they raid larger settlements under cover of night.&#10;Find Slave Pens&#10;The stench and horror of the Slave Pens of Goblin-town are the subject of dark rumour among travellers who must brave the High Pass, for it is well-known that the goblins delight in taking such folk captive and dragging them down into the depths of the Mountains where they are pressed into cruel labour in the darkness, and few ever again see the light of day.&#10;Find Gollum's Cave&#10;Gollum's cave is a dark, silent lake nestled down near the roots of the Misty Mountains, and it is said that even goblins fear it greatly and rarely come here. The famed hobbit-burglar Bilbo Baggins stumbled into this cave long ago, when Dori dropped him off, and there met the wretched creature Gollum. It is said he won his freedom through a Riddle-game, but there is rumour that he did not play fairly.&#10;Find The Great Goblin's Den&#10;The throne room of Goblin-town, the Den of the Great Goblin, is not a place where most travellers wish to find themselves. Possessed of an odd and unfair sense of justice, the goblins usually bring their captives before the Great Goblin to face his judgement rather than simply imprisoning or killing them. His judgement for presumptive crimes usually involves spying or trespassing upon the goblins' domain. Unfortunately for the hapless captives, the outcome of these encounters if fore-ordained, and the punishment for such infractions is always unpleasant -- and ultimately fatal.&#10;Find The Deep-fires&#10;This sweltering cave houses the forges of Goblin-town, where cruel implements of war and torture are fashioned by over-clever smiths whose knowledge descends from ages ago when the Dark Lord taught them the arts of metalsmithy.&#10;Find Eglanúr&#10;The true origin of the ruins that can be found scattered in these caverns is unknown. It is clear that once the dwarves delved here and built their tunnels and mines, but this was lost and abandoned to the goblins so long ago that even among Durin's Folk there are few who remember the names of those who built it or how their story came to an end.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Golu o Maeth was composed, it is said, by a great scholar of ancient Doriath. It is one of the oldest translations of the fundamentals of Rune-craft, an examination of the Tengwar in particular and their relationship to the powers of combat. This lore was thought lost after the destruction of Beleriand, though rumors persisted that at least one copy was brought east of the Ered Luin before then. Age has not been kind to this volume, however, and many of its pages have crumbled to dust. Even so, Elrond of Rivendell would certainly regard it as a relic beyond compare." objectives="Golu o Maeth, page 7&#10;What a moving passage is found on this page: it says 'When a Rune-keeper means to fight, muse not on weapons or fervour, but instead on the effect of sea-waves on a sharp stone, or a sheet of paper on the wind. Thither bends the thought of a Rune-keeper.'&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 8&#10;The author writes here about the matter of choice when given the chance to win by gentle healing, or by glory in battle, for the Rune-keeper may be a powerful aggressor.&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 12&#10;An elegant list of beneficial war-craft is laid out in the scrawl on this plate. Many useful descriptions shed light on lore long since forgotten ere the missing leaf was recovered.&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 18&#10;I read here that the author of Golu o Maeth was a Rune-keeper of great renown in his day, walking the earth long in search of all manner of lore for his ever-expanding compilation. His collection of words of war-craft is unmatched.&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 19&#10;Some of the runes laid out here have never been recorded elsewhere, making this page a precious relic.&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 22&#10;This page dispels many of the misconceptions associated with the power of a Rune-keeper. Many are misinformed, believing that a Rune-keeper uses 'magic', but it is rather a subtle art of incantation using common language with nature.&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 24&#10;This page contains a single rune only; its power must be great indeed.&#10;Golu o Maeth, page 31&#10;This ink-drawing shows symbols of battle, and runes are laid over them to reveal from whence each letter was derived.">

It was here that Durin completed his legendary journey through the heart of the mountains and came once again into the light of the sun, having discovered the place that would become his people's home for ages to come.&#10;Find The Chamber of the Crossroads 5.1S/112.1W (Durin's Way)&#10;This ancient guard room controls the passages leading up into Durin's Way, as well as the ones east, toward the Twenty-first Hall. It is now occupied by part of the dwarf-expedition to reclaim Moria from the orcs and goblins who now hold sway.&#10;Find The Twenty-first Hall 5.8S/105.3W (Zelem-melek)&#10;The Twenty-first Hall is among the largest in all of Khazad-dûm, and often regarded as the most famous. In times long past a great market stood here where the Dwarves of Moria and travellers from abroad would trade in fine goods from across much of Middle-earth. Fine woods an wine and foodstuffs would be exchanged for gold and priceless gems and finely wrought pieces of smith-craft. In truth nearly anything at all could be bought or sold within this very hall, though it is hard to imagine to look upon it now.&#10;Find Chamber of Mazarbul 4.7S/105.3W (Zelem-melek)&#10;It is likely that the Chamber of Mazarbul once served some great ceremonial purpose in the old days of Moria; now it remains the tomb of Balin, son of Fundin and friend to old Bilbo, who, not so many years ago, led an expedition much like the current one to retake Moria and restore it to the glories of old.&#10;Find the Bridge of Khazad-dûm (west arch) 8.0S/99.2W (Nud-melek)&#10;The bridge of Khazad-dûm was conceived as an ancient defence designed to deter any who might seek to invade the city. The chasm it crosses is among the largest in Moria, and has been here since the city was founded thousands of years ago. Now the bridge lies in ruin, its western span jutting forlornly out over the depths of the chasm, the very stone shattered and charred by unknown forces.&#10;Find the Bridge of Khazad-dûm (east arch) 8.0S/98.6W (Nud-melek)&#10;The Bridge of Khazad-dûm has stood over this great chasm for many a long age, but does so no more. The eastern span now reaches out like a finger pointing into the darkness beyond. It seems that whatever destroyed the bridge fell not so long ago, as flakes of rock can still be seen occasionally cracking away from the shattered tip to fall into the chasm, and fresh arrows pepper the stonework there.&#10;Find the First Hall 8.0S/96.3W (Nud-melek)&#10;The First Hall was the original entrance to Khazad-dûm, where Durin first set foot in the caverns that would one day become the greatest city of the Dwarves, and indeed the most enduring city of any people in the long history of Middle-earth, until at last it fell into ruin.">

<deed key="Knee-breaker%27s_Manual" name="Knee-breaker's Manual" type="CLASS" class="Burglar" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual is an odd tome -- it appears to be written in a rather careful and precise script, but the passages themselves describe a particularly coarse and savage individual. Whoever he was, the exploits described in this book certainly lean to the unsavoury side of the burglar's profession. Nevertheless, there are a number of intriguing points that the author of the book presents.&#10;&#10;Frustratingly, several key pages are missing. It is said that the famous burglar Bilbo Baggins has undertaken a study of the profession since his retirement -- perhaps he could tell you something about this 'Knee-breaker' or the missing sections of his manual?" objectives="Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 1&#10;By the end of the first page it is clear that the author of this book is not Knee-breaker himself, but some considerably more refined lieutenant of his. This unknown author appears to be taking pains to reflect the nature of his employer in his writing, which has resulted in an odd mixture of refined grammar and script that tells the story of a particularly vulgar and unrefined individual.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 3&#10;As you read more, there is no question that Knee-breaker was little more than a ruffian and a brigand, selling his services to the highest bidder with little regard to the unsavoury nature of the jobs he undertook.&#10;The trouble is that he was apparently very, very good at what he did, due to some trick of instinct that guided him unerringly to exploit the weaknesses of those he fought against.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 4&#10;This page describes Knee-breaker's band. It cannot really be called anything else -- a band of individuals who followed him almost entirely out of fear, which he encouraged, having little use for real friendship.&#10;Knee-breaker himself seems to have rarely taken the risk of fighting alone, preferring instead to set up his victims for a thorough beating at the hands of his subordinates. The idea of a fair fight was probably as foreign to him as bathing.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 8&#10;As you decipher the script upon this page, it becomes clear that the true purpose of this manual was an effort by the unknown author to translate Knee-breaker's instincts for brutality and cunning into a more intellectual form that could be learned or taught -- and then used to the author's own benefit.&#10;Surprisingly, this author seems to have made considerable headway in learning the true nature of Knee-breaker's cunning, and the notes contained herein do seem to be hinting towards some important knowledge.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 10&#10;This page describes a particular revelation of the writer in his observation of Knee-breaker -- namely the degree to which he relied on sudden and brutal surprise, not just to throw his enemy off-balance, but more importantly to create a crystal-clear moment upon which even the most dull-witted of his underlings could seize to jump upon and overwhelm the enemy before their own cowardice and doubt hamper the assault.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 15&#10;According to this passage, Knee-breaker would often as not neglect to even follow up upon his own surprising assaults, preferring to leave most of the battle to his underlings so that he could keep the situation entirely under his supervision and not be drawn into a melee unecessarily.&#10;This apparently made it even more difficult for one of his untrustworthy followers to turn upon him at a crucial moment and gave him the opportunity to land the showy finishing blow should he feel a need to display his own prowess to his followers.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 16&#10;The tone of this page has changed considerably. At this point, the book no longer appears to be relating observations of Knee-breaker's own techiniques and exploits, so much as it has become a dissertation of the author's own understanding of the brute's methods.&#10;The text becomes more difficult to follow as it wanders into more abstract elements of the technique, but it also begins to make it much clearer how one might actually duplicate Knee-breaker's flats without the benefit of his raw brutality and animal cunning.&#10;Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 19&#10;The last page of the manual appears to be a description of Knee-breaker's untimely demise and a fond farewell passage in his honour.&#10;The author's underlying tone of irony belies little love lost for his dead master, and though the text does not make it clear, the hints between the lines suggest quite strongly that the author was most likely the main architect of his betrayal and demise, apparently having learned all he cared to from the unfortunate brute.">

Massive creatures now inhabit the Gorge, making travel through the area perilous, and it is said that even the trees themselves sometimes move about, perhaps thanks to some strange magic from the neighboring forest of Fangorn..." objectives="Discover 7 locations:&#10;Discover the Limlight Gatehouse 25.4S/67.0W (The Great River)&#10;When the last inhabitants of the Limlight Gorge were driven out by the arrival of trolls from the Misty Mountains, the Rohirrim erected this guard-post to keep an eye on the entrance to the Gorge and ensure that nothing came out it unseen. Luckily, the trolls dare not stray too far from the caves and ledges they take cover beneath during cloudless days, and so they have made no attempt to come up out of the Gorge.&#10;Discover Limlight Falls 28.5S/72.3W (The Great River)&#10;The Limlight Falls mark the bottom extent of the foothills leading down from the Misty Mountains as the rushing river empties out towards the plains to the south.&#10;The cold rushing stream ensures a steady supply of fresh water for the communinty of Stangard.'&#10;&#10;Discover the Ent-grove 29.4S/72.1W (The Great River)&#10;The northernmost extent of the forest of Fangorn ends here, at the banks of the Limlight River.&#10;The Ents have long had a small gathering place here, where they would long ago meet with the Elves of Lothlórien and learn news of the outside world.&#10;&#10;Discover the Fallen Watchtower 28.1S/68.6W (The Great River)&#10;This ancient Gondorian tower once watched over the Limlight Gorge.&#10;To what purpose, or against what threat, no-one today remembers, for it fell to ruin long, long ago.&#10;&#10;Discover the Pothole 27.3S/71.3W (The Great River)&#10;This old river pothole remains from time long past when the Limlight's course ran further up the Gorge. It left this oddly smoothed pit behind as it shifted course.&#10;Now, alas, it seems that trolls have taken up residence within its deep shadows.&#10;&#10;Discover the Prospector's Shack 27.0S/69.9W (The Great River)&#10;This may once have been a homestead or hunting-cabin down in the Gorge, but more recently it has been the waypost for a band of prospectors and treasure-seekers exploring the Gorge for valuable minerals.&#10;&#10;Discover the Old Sawmill 29.0S/69.7W (The Great River)&#10;This old sawmill was built some years ago by the Men of Stangard, before the trolls arrived and drove them away.&#10;&#10;More recently it appears that a band of hard-working but obstinately foolish dwarves have been trying to restore the mill to working order.">

<deed key="Lore_of_the_Blade" name="Lore of the Blade" type="CLASS" class="Lore-master" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair. The author also proves to be a bit difficult to pin down, as he has chosen to identify himself solely by the runic letter 'G' inscribed on the binding." objectives="Lore of the Blade, page 5&#10;This page describes the heroine's close escape from a deadly trap set by brigands in the employ of the dreaded Witch-king of Angmar, in which she manages to convince her pursuers that a powerful Elf-warrior is about to set upon them through the trick of throwing her voice.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 11&#10;In this chapter, the heroine confounds a pair of particularly strong but stupid Orcs into undertaking a Contest of Riddles -- against each other. During the game, she goads the pair into arguing over the rules until one finally kills the other in anger and is in turn skewered by the heroine's own sword.&#10;You are not entirely sure that she was playing by the rules herself, but suppose that victory is prime motivator of the Law when you are a young girl dealing with a pair of rampaging Orcs.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 18&#10;In this chapter, our heroin finds herself trapped in a cave crawling with giants spiders of a decidedly evil and hungry sort. Witty banter and deception are swiftly discarded in this plight, as the valiant young girl resorts to tricks and conjurations of flame and the edge of her blade to slash and burn her way to freedom, barely dodging poisoned mandibles and lassoes of web a dozen times as she escapes from the horrid cave.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 26&#10;This chapter finds our heroin challenged by the border guards of Gondor as she continues her travels. Desperate to proceed and unable to think of any other way to proceed, she rashly challenges the captain of the guards to a duel, wherein she fights valiantly to the last, but is soundly bested by her skilled opponent.&#10;The captain, deeply impressed by her unwavering bravery and valour even in the face of certain defeat, determines that she may only cross the border with an appropriate escort to ensure her good behaviour -- an escort that he personally offers to provide.&#10;Thus she is able to continue her quest, albeit bruised for a time in body and pride, but now with a capable companion to aid her.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 35&#10;This chapter describes the heroine's journey with her self-appointed guardian through the realm of Gondor. The book goes into some detail on how the captain instructs the young woman in the finer points of swordsmanship during the course of her travels.&#10;Interestingly, the advice this character offers sounds quite reasonable and realistic, at least compared to the rather fantastic tone of most of the rest of the book.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 45&#10;This page includes a particularly tense and thrilling sequence where the young Lore-master and her companion are ambushed by a vicious band of goblins.&#10;Poisoned by their darts and barely able to fight, the captain is rescued by his own charge as she puts his training in the blade to good use against their attackers.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 56&#10;In this chapter, the heroine finally reaches her goal in the great city of Minas Tirith, wherein she is finally able to arrange an audience with the King of Gondor who turns out to be a very clever, but odd fellow who engages her in a complex contest of lore and wits during their conversation.&#10;In time, they come to a stalemate, at which the old ruler having taken a shine to the girl for her spirit and knowledge allows her access to the royal libraries, where the goal of her quest may lie.&#10;Lore of the Blade, page 68&#10;Finally, approaching the ultimate goal of her quest, our heroine delves into the royal libraries of Gondor, seeking the key piece of knowledge she needs to save her parents who have been held under the curse of an evil sorcerer far to the North.&#10;To her horror, she discovers something among the ancient, dusty scrolls to suggest that not only her parents are in danger, but indeed all the people of the North may well be in deadly peril if she cannot warn them in time.&#10;Alas, the story ends there after only hinting at the true nature of the evil in the North, and with the young Lore-master preparing to journey forth with all haste.&#10;A cliffhanger? Curses! Now you will never know how it was supposed to end. Looks like that mangy old wizard has gotten the last laugh again....">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;It is said in the most ancient of tales that the world was formed in a great chorus of song, but this story is ancient and shrouded in myth even to the oldest among the living Elves, and no one in Middle-earth today could claim to know the truth of it. Towards the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance, there was born a fair woman who sang in such wonderous tones that even the Elves would stop and listen in silence for so long as she would sing for them. Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.&#10;&#10;Melodies of the Valar is the book that contains these songs as the Elves transcribed them, but most of the copies of this book have been taken away into the West, and very few remain in Middle-earth today. Alas, this one has been damaged, but an Elven minstrel of renown might well be able to shed some light on the matter." objectives="Melodies of the Valar, page 12&#10;Like many of the songs in Melodies of the Valar, this one is wordless, guiding the voice of the performer as an instrument.&#10;The song itself seems to conjure in the mind of the listener the image of a babbling brook beneath the foothills of some distant and long-forgotten mountain.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 14&#10;The lyrics of the song upon this page are in some strange language even the Elves do not recognize. While in some respects it sounds similar to Sindarin, it is nevertheless alien.&#10;When listening to the words a sense of unmeasurable ages settles upon you, as if the singer were attempting to describe a time before even the Elves set foot upon the lands of Middle-earth.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 23&#10;This song is meant to be sung in a chorus of voices, starting with one and each entering the chorus in turn.&#10;It is said that when it is performed correctly beneath the light of the stars, the sound rises ever upwards drawing the listeners with it into a rapt contemplation of the vastness of the star-strewn sky.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 24&#10;This quiet piece evokes a sense of suspended tension in the air, much as one might feel in the rumbling forerunners of a summer storm flickering upon the horizon.&#10;How a woman's voice could convey such feelings is unclear, but the effect is unmistakably powerful.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 27&#10;This page presents a slow and sonorous melody. It is hard to imagine how a woman's fair voice could have created such a deep tone.&#10;Its words are mysterious and no known language describes them, but the listener may find themselves transported into an ancient realm beneath the earth, seemingly accompanied by the tread of heavy boots upon stone and the glimmer of vast caverns formed of lime and crystal, seen as if for the first time by any living eyes. In time, the chant reaches its end and the listener finds himself awakening as if from a deep slumber.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 29&#10;This song wells with deep sadness, speaking of honour long fallen to pride and a people lost in dreams of forgotten glory. The music meanders along a bittersweet path that seems to lead inevitably towards the swelling roar of the ocean, along a mythic shore lost beneath the endless waves ages ago.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 30&#10;This song is strikingly different from all those that come before. It speaks to the listener of valour, strength, and the achievements of great craft. Clear and certain tones strike a chord deep within any who would lead or who strive to achieve.&#10;Yet from this lofty beginning it continues without abatement, speaking of the authority of Kings and of the unquenchable pride of one who must master all they attempt. The tones become uncomfortably assertive, assailing the listener, seeming to place a weight upon their shoulders, pushing ever more firmly downwards.&#10;The final chord reaches a victorious peak as the voice of the singer booms out over the audience with unquestionable authority, demanding submission and adulation from all who listen. It is a powerful, stirring piece, yet some of those who hear it also find it to be profoundly disturbing.&#10;Melodies of the Valar, page 32&#10;This last piece is most unusual. It is sung in a single voice that conjures forth the image of an infinitely patient crafter building a castle out of tiny pebbles upon the beach, that time and again is dashed away by angry tides. Yet with each passing of the tide the structure grows, becoming ever more grand over ages of quiet labour.&#10;In the end, the song describes an ancient and beautiful fortress, weathered with the passage of tide and time, inhabited by an elegant, noble people and bearing the banners of a hundred honourable houses upon its walls, standing impregnable upon the edge of an ocean whose tides still crash below -- still violent, but humbled by the crafter's patient art.&#10;Given that the song offers no words to be understood by mortal (or Elven) ears, it seems odd that such concepts might be conveyed, and yet it does so with remarkable clarity.">

I regret I can tell you nothing about this relic that you have not seen for yourself; the type is familiar to me, but I do not know what it may mean.&#10;&#10;I can tell you what lies beyond the sealed door in those caves, however. Long ago, when the kingdom of Rhudaur was at its height, evil Men worshipped dark powers at a temple in the wilderness. The route overland to the temple has not been taken in many years and is surely overgrown; I have dispatched scouts from time to time to search for it.&#10;&#10;I believe that the sealed door leads underground to the temple, &lt;name&gt;. It is said some terrible thing befell the Men of Rhudaur within its walls. Let it remain sealed, for now.

I have not heard much news on that score, but I will keep my ears open. The common room is busy most nights, and if talk turns to such things, I will note it down.&#10;&#10;Hard times are ahead, if you ask me. Strange folk on the road, unpleasant news from distant parts...it's enough to make you wonder. You can't let it trouble you too much, that's what I've always said. There's just too much to be done! You'll stay calm, &lt;name&gt;, no matter what lies ahead? Ha! It's good advice! More could make do with some of that, if you ask me!&#10;&#10;I'll let you know if I hear anything. I'll just write down a bit of a note to remind me. Anything else I can do for you, &lt;name&gt;? The Pony is at your service, of course...you just name what you want.">

Moria was indeed the most enduring city of any people in the long history of Middle-earth, until at last it fell and the end came, as it must to all things.&#10;Find Khadar-zarâm 8.0S/103.6W (Nud-melek)&#10;This vast array of stairs allows one to descend from the seat of Durin's power to the greatest hall in all of Khazad-dûm. Originally a vast natural cavern supported by massive pillars of stone, over the long years the dwarves gradual worked it into a wonder of craftsmanship, with a forest of pillars carved into great trees supporting the weight of an entire mountain above.&#10;Find The Deep Crossroad 6.3S/101.1W (Nud-melek)&#10;This junction between the vast hall in Nud-melek and the Chamber of Mazarbul farther to the west seems unimportant in the vastness of Moria, but for some reason Mazog's Orcs guard it with a keen vigilance and attack all passersby therein.&#10;Find Khurjezer 7.3S/100.9W (Nud-melek)&#10;Khurjezer appears to be the only remaining bridge across the lesser chasm that has rent the great hall of Nud-melek. This chasm does not appear in the ancient maps of Khazad-dûm, and it is possible that an earthquake ripped it apart in the years shortly before the appearance of Durin's Bane.&#10;Find the Bridge of Khazad-dûm (west arch) 8.0S/99.2W (Nud-melek)&#10;The bridge of Khazad-dûm was conceived as an ancient defence designed to deter any who might seek to invade the city. The chasm it crosses is among the largest in Moria, and has been here since the city was founded so many long years ago. Its depths seem wholly bottomless to the reckoning of a mortal eye. Now the bridge lies in ruins, its western span jutting forlornly out over the depths of the chasm, the very stone shattered and charred by unknown forces.&#10;Find the Bridge of Khazad-dûm (east arch) 8.0S/98.6W (Nud-melek)&#10;The bridge of Khazad-dûm has stood over this great chasm for many an age, but does so no more. THe eastern span now reaches out like a finger pointing into the darkness beyond.

<deed key="Of_Leaf_and_Twig" name="Of Leaf and Twig" type="CLASS" class="Lore-master" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;This is a strange book indeed. The covers are crafted from strips of some fibrous bark supple enough to be woven together, while the pages themselves appear to be birch bark pounded carefully flat and gently inscribed with runic letters in dense rows, page after page. What magic can have allowed such a fragile-looking tome to survive time and age, you cannot guess. Nor have you ever seen a book of such length, for its author goes into each subject and sentence with such painstaking detail that you cannot imagine how long it must have taken to record it all in this fashion. The subject appears to be anything with roots and leaves. There is such an enormous breadth of knowledge concerning root, leaf, bark, and twig that you could likely study it for years without understanding it all.&#10;&#10;To your ire, someone or something has carefully removed a few of the pages from the volume, leaving you to wonder what hidden lore they must have contained. Perhaps the master of the Last Homely House could shed some light on this mysterious tome -- you can think of few others who might." objectives="Of Leaf and Twig, page 8&#10;This page begins a list of plants that may be found in the forests of northern Middle-earth, including every sub-species and variety.&#10;It appears to go on for at least another ten pages -- in very, very small print -- and you are sure you have not even heard of half of them.&#10;You find yourself wondering how many years it must have taken to compile that list.&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 23&#10;This page begins a long, rambling dissertation on the shape of leaves. It describes all the varieties of leaf, including colours, shapes, stems, and vein patterns.&#10;By the end of the tract, you begin to realize that the author has tied them all back together in a most interesting fashion.&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 53&#10;The author spends a great deal of time discussing the methods by which plants procreate, from seed and nut, to root and creeper. You had not realized before just how many variations there really were.&#10;There is even a section dedicated to a particular type of tree that only spreads itself after death, as young new trees sprout up along the length of the old tree's fallen, rotting trunk.&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 77&#10;This section speaks of the proper ways to nourish and tend young plants.&#10;It reads quite unlike a common book on farming, however, as it is concerned more with the development of wild fields and forests and has little to say about harvesting or sowing in the traditional sense.&#10;The author does not seem to consider the development of crops as a meaningful pursuit, so much as the creation of a vibrant, living glade or meadow.&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 98&#10;This section delves into the lore of roots and their interaction with the earth, discussing their purpose and growth and the effect they have upon rock and soil.&#10;Most interestingly, it discusses the method by which small hardy bushes and trees cling to harsh, bare rock, slowly breaking it apart year after long year, until in time greater trees and lush undergrowth may take its place amongst the shattered rock and reach into the earth below.&#10;The process must take centuries -- even the immortal Elves have not the patience to watch such things -- yet the author writes as if he has seen these events first-hand.&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 145&#10;This section goes on at great length concerning the matter of water and its importance to all living things.&#10;It notes how many species of tree and plant grow upon the edge of running water and in time come to shape its course to their own needs and purposes, much as a farmer might irrigate a field.&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 162&#10;This page speaks of the long battles fought amongst plants, as they struggle to live like any other thing.&#10;The author speaks of these conflicts almost as if they were fought amongst regiments and armies of Men, yet it is clear that these 'wars' are fought out over endless years, and the struggle itself is unguided by any General or King save the forces of nature themselves -- excepting of course when the younger races come wielding axe and fire and upset this order, and events come to move more swiftly.&#10;Oddly, the author seems to nonchalantly include even the Elves and dwarves amongst the 'younger races' as a matter of course....&#10;Of Leaf and Twig, page 241&#10;This last section lacks an index of any sort, much as the beginning had no chapters -- as if such an idea simply had not occured to the author, and he expected anyone hefting this massive tome to simply read it through from end to end, even if all they sought was the name of a particular flower.&#10;As a reference, this book is nearly useless despite its encyclopedic volume, but you are forced to admit that you have never encountered such a vast and comprehensive book concerning the true nature and qualities of plants.">

<deed key="Ruins_of_Evendim" name="Ruins of Evendim" type="EXPLORER" category="Region:Evendim" description="Explore the ruins of ancient Arnor." objectives="Find Tham Nambarth 12.1S/65.6W (Evendim)&#10;Several of the great families of Annúminas constructed palatial estates upon the rolling hills of the Evendim Fields, displaying their wealth and prosperity far and wide and providing them summer estates from which they might oversee their extensive holdings of rich croplands. Though not as extravagant as some of the estates built later, Tham Nambarth was the oldest and closest to the capital and thus considered the most prestigious of all, save for that of the royal family itself at Tinnudir.&#10;Find Tham Varan 12.1S/63.9W (Evendim)&#10;The estate of Tham Varan once belonged to one of the oldest and most prestigious families of Annúminas. They were known for a long and, at times, strange contest for influence in the royal courts of Arnor against their arch-rivals who lived near on at Tham Nambarth. From this contentious situation arose a number of favoured tales of intrigue, forbidden love, and all manner if noble improprieties that have titillated the common folk for centuries since.&#10;Find Ost Heryn 11.2S/61.6W (Evendim)&#10;Originally built as a fortress to oversee the approach to the Fields of Evendim from the east. Ost Heryn was allowed to languish during the long periods of peace that characterized those times. It was eventually purchased by a newly prosperous family of merchants and converted into a luxurious estate. Alas, the fortunes of Ost Heryn were sorely treated in later years when threats arose unlooked for from the East and it became a rich target of raiders and bandits.&#10;Find Tham Andalath 9.5S/63.1W (Evendim)&#10;Constructed during the height of Annúminas' influence and wealth in the North, the estate of Tham Andalath became the largest in the Evendim Fields. It quickly became known as a symbol of upstart extravagance and was known for its excessively lavish events and its unabashed influence peddling amongst the lesser houses.&#10;Find Tham Ornen 8.7S/66.7W (Evendim)&#10;The smallest of the great houses of Arnor built their estate here at Tham Ornen. While they could not claim the wealth or power of the other houses, it is said that this family had close ties with the Royal line of the Kings of Annúminas. As such they suffered few of the more difficult turns of fate that befell many of the other houses, and were highly respected throughout their long history. Nevertheless, their fate became inextricably twined with that of the royal line so as the power of Arnor fragmented and faded, so too did the family at Tham Ornen fade into the pages of history.&#10;Find Barad Rath 7.3S/66.6W (Evendim)&#10;Constructed before the original founding of Ost Forod, Barad Rath once stood as the furthest northern frontier in the region of Lake Evendim. Once Ost Forod rose to pre-eminence in the north Barad Rath declined in importance and is believed to have been used as an occasional retreat for members of the Royal family who could not find sufficient peace and isolation in the bustling courts of Annúminas or their estate at Tinnudir.&#10;Find Rantost 7.2S/69.6W (Evendim)&#10;Given the evidence of the beautiful and extensive structures once built on the island of Rantost, it is strangely devoid of mention in the histories of Arnor. It is possible that some powerful family seeking a more reclusive and quiet lifestyle far from the continual chaos of the capital chose to construct their estate here - but if so that same reclusive nature has erased any mention of them from the tales and histories of the Northern Kingdom, and they are lost to time forever.&#10;Find Tollobel 11.4S/71.9W (Evendim)&#10;Isolated by the lake from most of the other estates and ruins of Evendim, few scholars are certain of the nature of the ruins that lie there today. The foremost theories suggest that it may have once been either a prison or vault used by the rulers of Annúminas - this at least would explain the general secrecy and rare mention of the place in histories of the region. Alas, there is little solid evidence to support these ideas, save for a series of unusually deep and extensive cellars within the crumbling ruins. If there were vaults here, they have long ago been picked over for any valuables they might have contained.">

Those that are to be found here were built long ago by the dwarves." objectives="Find Glóin's Camp 24.8S/4.0W (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Only here can the Longbeards still be found in the Misty Mountains, and only in this small lonely camp built amongst the crumbled ruins of older, far grander dwarf-holdings. The few brave dwarves who have come here face insurmountable odds in taming of these wild peaks, however, and the task seems impossible so long as the power of Angmar continues to grow in the far north.&#10;Find Hríthur's Haven 24.9S/1.9E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Once this ruin led into a haven used by dwarf-hunters and scouts who roamed the Misty Mountains in their incessant battles against the goblins. Now it lies sealed and abandoned, the sturdy warriors who once manned it long ago driven from the Mountains.&#10;Find Iskeld's Lookout 21.5S/4.6W (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Iskeld's Lookout is one of the oldest dwarf-outposts in the northern Misty Mountains. It was built to stand guard over the source of the river Bruinen and ensure that no enemy would be able to interfere with the life-giving flow of waters down into lands below. After the fall of the Longbeard's fortress to the south, Iskeld’s Lookout was abandoned, and only wild and terrible beasts roam here now.&#10;Find The Bitter Stair 17.9S/2.2W (The Misty Mountains)&#10;The Bitter Stair is a treacherous switchback that leads to the gate of the dwarf-fortress of Helegrod – once the largest of the holdings of Durin's Folk in this region of Middle-earth, until in the Second Age it was sacked by the dragon Thorog and his brood, who claimed Helegrod as his lair. Some years later, a force of dwarves led by a great hero fought their way up these stairs to the fortress. Many of their number were flung to their deaths below by the drakes which defended the approach, but in the end the hero fought his way into the fortress and did indeed slay Thorog. Alas, so many Dwarves were lost in the battle that they were forced to abandon it to the dragon’s brood, and they have never returned thence.">

<deed key="The_Artisan_Blade" name="The Artisan Blade" type="CLASS" class="Champion" minimumLevel="39" description="Given the title, you half expected that this book would have been written by an Elf -- and indeed the script is Sindarin -- but it seems that the author is a champion of some ancient Númenórean lineage from a time before the founding of Arnor. The text is so ancient that some of the pages threaten to crumble in your hands as you carefully peruse it. While the dialect is ancient and difficult to read, the author's approach to swordsmanship is rather unusual, placing a great deal of emphasis on grueling repetition and concentration around what appear to be the most basic motions of the form. It suggests a focus on absolute control and power, which then leads to the discovery of finesse and artistry.&#10;&#10;If only several key passages and pages were not missing, it could be an invaluable training guide -- perhaps Gimli the Dwarf could tell you more?" objectives="The Artisan Blade, Page 2&#10;The early sections of this book seem to focus on the importance of basic drills -- similar to many another warrior's guide. But the author goes into some depth on the purpose of these mindless activities and suggests some novel meditative techniques to be used before and after the drills to improve their efficacy.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 4&#10;This page proves to be more of a text on the healing arts, than on fighting. The author cautions that the strain of such rigorous drills may injure a warrior ere he ever reaches the field of battle and suggests a particular regimen of herbal compresses and heated cloths to help the muscles and joints heal more quickly after the grueling exercises.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 6&#10;Never have you seen such attention to detail in a warrior's treatise.&#10;The author has gone so far as the measure of strength with which a blow must land to rend an enemy's armour, be it leather, chain, or tempered dwarf-steel. He then goes into how one may train himself to gauge the strength of his own blows to ensure that the blow lands truly each time, with no waste of strength or motion.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 9&#10;This page is covered in diagrams of the arm, displaying numerous positions of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, as well as their ranges of motion.&#10;It seems to be an exploration of the possible forms in which a weapon might be swung to its best effect.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 14&#10;This page lists a series of weights that may be attached to one's blade of mace to gradually increase its weight and further strengthen the arm during practice drills. The author suggests a slow but unwaveringly steady series of increases, up to the point where the weights seem impractical for anyone who is not a troll to manage.&#10;You find yourself wondering a bit about the sincerity of the author, but so much of the book is gruelingly logical and methodical that you imagine he must really be serious. How many of his students actually survived this regimen may be a more pertinent question.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 15&#10;This page is used to describe the training area that the author constructed for himself. It seems large and unsurprisingly spartan, focusing only on those necessities of the art of combat, forgoing virtually all other comforts and distractions.&#10;You doubt that this fellow got around to many festivals or had a lot of friends.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 17&#10;This page is the first to discuss technique beyond the most basic of motions. It discusses the momentum of the weapon, stating that the student -- who presumably had dutifully followed all that came before -- must now learn how to retain the speed and power of his strikes, whether they strike wood, metal, flesh, or air as the opponent moves and blocks in turn.&#10;The warrior that is capable of keeping his weapon in motion throughout all these movements of battle will tire more slowly and retain the advantage as he forces his opponent to react again and again, rather than acting in turn.&#10;The Artisan Blade, Page 26&#10;The author provides a summary of the training and drills offered throughout the book, tying them all together in the same clear and spartan fashion as all that came before.&#10;You find yourself believing that even a child could learn to fight masterfully following these methods -- assuming that said child had some troll's blood in his veins and a fanatical devotion to swordsmanship that most would consider unhealthily obsessive....">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;This book was written as a primer in the Guardian's art some time in the middle of the Third Age, during the difficult period after the fall of Khazad-dûm. At that time, Durin's Folk were scattered and greatly reduced in number, and the Guardian's role took on a much greater importance as the threat of goblins and Orcs to dwarf-settlements beneath the roots of the world became more and more common. The dwarves often settled for building powerful strongholds designed to make the approach to their cities, impervious to assault, manning them with skilled and powerful guardians to ensure that none would pass unchallenged.&#10;&#10;While the book itself is common enough, the owner of this copy seems to have scribbled copious notes within the margins of the pages -- notes containing an experience and insight to the art that even at a glance exceeds that of the original author. Unfortunately, the copy is worn and tattered, and a number of pages are missing. Perhaps someone well-versed in the art could provide you with some insight as to the identity of the mysterious scribbler and where his remaining notes could be found?" objectives="The Best Defense, Page 2&#10;This page, part of the introduction, reveals that the author was the chief of the guards of Thráin I, forebear of the Great Thorin Oakenshield and the first King Under the Mountain.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 3&#10;This page sets up the premise of the book with an ancient and terribly trite cliche: &quot;A good offence is the best defence.&quot;.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 5&#10;This page describes some of the more rudimentary stances a guardian can use to take full advantage of mistakes made by his foes.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 9&#10;This page continues the instruction given by the author, expounding upon nuances of combat that allow a guardian to breach an enemy's defences by countering its attacks.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 12&#10;This page includes many rough sketches of the stances and movements the author described in previous pages, but they are rather difficult to follow out of context.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 16&#10;On this page, the author begins to demonstrate advanced stances which allow a guardian to block an incoming attack, while quickly returning a blow of his own with greater power. The technique is not nearly as simple as it sounds.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 17&#10;This final diagram explains more completely the techniques shown in the previous pages. What read simply is far more complex than the reader might imagine.&#10;The Best Defence, Page 19&#10;This final page summarizes the entire treatise and puts more fully into context the teachings of The Best Defence.">

<deed key="The_Book_of_Beasts" name="The Book of Beasts" type="CLASS" class="Lore-master" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;It is unclear who wrote this book as no author's name is given, but the clarity and wisdom with which it is written only adds further to the mystery of its apparently modest writer. The Book of Beasts speaks at great length of the bonds which may be formed between creatures of the wilds and those among the Free Peoples of Middle-earth who are willing to understand their own true natures. It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.&#10;&#10;Whoever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind. Most of the text is clear, but some few of the pages are written in a hopeless scrawl with no meaning in any language of Elves or Men that you can discern. Indeed, it seems as if the scribe must have been taken with fits of madness during these passages. Perhaps Elrond of Rivendell might be able to tell you more about the mysterious author and help you untangle the riddle of the meaningless passages." objectives="The Book of Beasts, page 3&#10;This page heads a basic taxonomy of many of the more common beasts and birds of Middle-earth, offering a short entry describing their names, forms, and where they might be found. The author must be incredibly well-travelled or else has conversed with those who have brought much knowledge from abroad, for the regions he describes extend far beyond the borders of the Kingdoms of the West, into foreign lands with strange and alien names -- and equally odd beasts.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 6&#10;This section is dedicated to a discussion of the songs of the smallest of birds and their meanings. The concepts the author describes are not nearly as flighty as one might imagine given the beautiful and transient nature of their songs.&#10;It would appear that even songbirds must discuss matters of serious import -- at least on occasion.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 8&#10;This page describes the diet of bears, which seems to vary considerably from one species to the next. Most it seems would eat the sweet berries and roots to be found in many areas of Middle-earth, while only some will eat meat, and only a few prefer it. He describes the ferocity of bears mainly as a result of their territorial instincts, particularly when mothering cubs and further suggests that this is a power that can be tapped by one who has learned to understand them sufficiently well.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 14&#10;This page involves a lengthy discussion of seeds: what plants produce seeds that are edible and which species of animals rely upon them. It offers nothing to help unravel the mystery of why the scribe who copied the original pages might have distorted them so badly.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 25&#10;This page again delves into bears...after a fashion.&#10;It describes a unique tribe of the animals -- unique at first in that they can be called a tribe, which is not common among bears, and secondly because the author proposes that these creatures can in fact take upon themselves the shape of Men should they find the need to do so!&#10;Unfortunately, the author seems prepared to guard the secret of this tribe rather jealously, offering no hints as to where these 'bear-men' might be found.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 26&#10;This page discusses the nature of the crebain, a particularly devious form of crow, depending on how you choose to classify them.&#10;These birds are widely known to have a predilection for mischief, but the author feels that it goes considerably deeper than that, suggesting that long ago their kind were offered a pact by some dark power in return for an intellect and cunning that extends well beyond that common among animals -- a pact which they accepted and that has bound them through ages since in thrall to that power.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 33&#10;This passage seems particularly interesting. Within it, the author discusses spiders at some length. He draws a stark comparison between the common spiders that you might find within your garden or basement, and those breeds that grow to dreadful sizes and display a hateful cunning and hunger.&#10;While most folk presume that these deadly creatures are simply greater forms of the more common spiders, the mysterious author suggests that these two branches of spider-kind are entirely unrelated. Indeed, he seems to suggest that all of the forms of giant spiders can in fact describe their lineage from a single horrifying monster who existed in long ages past, and that it is from her that their intelligence as well as their grotesque size are descended.&#10;The Book of Beasts, page 37&#10;Sitting towards the end of the book, this page delves into the power of a mysterious tribe of bear-men, noting that their power suggests a maleability of form that derives from the nature of the spirit -- even amongst Men. The author surmises that perhaps some nature of those who formed the world is present in some tribes of men and that this may be waht grants them such powers that otehrs lack. Or perhaps that nature is present in all men, and only some few have learned the secret of it. The author then rambles on a bit and supposes that the most likely answer is that they are really after all, and perhaps bears of a particularly foolish sort if they have chosen to take on the forms of men. How odd.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Book of Knives was written by a burglar of great renown -- she is even said to have retrieved the choicest gem of a hoard from beneath the grasping claw of a sleeping dragon -- but her true name remains unknown and many doubt the veracity of her most outlandish exploits. Nevertheless, she was acknowledged as one of the finest knife-fighters in Middle-earth during her time.&#10;&#10;Sadly, The Book of Knives is incomplete; little can be gleaned from its cryptic writings. The famous burglar Bilbo Baggins is known for his love of riddles and mysteries -- perhaps he might be able to shed some light on this text." objectives="The Book of Knives, Page 3&#10;A section of the introduction, this page suggests that the author was neither modest nor the type to shy from a fight. She was apparently overly fond of causing trouble at inns throughout Eriador. Sometimes going so far as to cheat openly at dice in order to provoke a fight.&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 5&#10;This page describes some of the author's favourite knives. It seems that she had an Elf-smith make blades for her as custom pieces which she particularly preferred for their speed and edge. She must have treated them rather roughly, given the sheer number of knives she describes in loving detail.&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 12&#10;The author appears to have preferred combat with an unusual level of intensity compared to what one might expect of a burglar. The style she describes emphasizes a degree of closure and commitment to finishing a fight quickly rather than the furtive hit-and-run tactics that one commonly associates with the profession.&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 17&#10;It is clear from the context of this page that the author preferred to work alone, without companions. This perhaps explains her dedication to the art of in-fighting and an emphasis on finishing fights up close and as quickly as possible. She likely had few friends or companions to fall back on in times of danger.&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 18&#10;This page is difficult to follow as it is covered with sketchy diagrams as well as scrawled text. It seems to be trying to describe some complex movement of the body, but the author was not much of an artist.&#10;Nevertheless, it does hint at some intriguing ideas you would like to try out....&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 23&#10;This page does not seem to have much to do with knife fighting.&#10;The author seems to have wandered into a rambling recollection of one of her more hair-raising exploits, the details of which are both quite bawdy, and rather too dramatic and unlikely to be an entirely honest account....&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 26&#10;A page of painstakingly inked lines and diagrams. It must be describing a particular set of motions.&#10;Unfortunately, the notes in the margins of the page are impossible to make out, leaving you to do a great deal of guesswork as to what motions this complex web of lines might actually be trying to depict.&#10;The Book of Knives, Page 31&#10;This page is a recap of much of what has been described before, but it is surprisingly concise and clear compared to most of what came before, drawing a number of important lines between the stylistic points that she has made previously. Either the author received some editorial assistance with this section, or perhaps she was just sober during its writing.&#10;In any case, it is an invaluable guide to sorting out the mismatched notes throughout the rest of the book.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Book of Oaths discusses the central role of Honour in true leadership and the sanctity of a King's Oath –- or a Captain's. Much of the power to guide men truly derives from the simple bond of Truth itself, and for those who lead, an Oath is a bond of commitment that cannot be broken without inviting a fate most dire. Indeed, a captain who would betray his own word risks more than his life, for it is well-known that an Oath fatefully taken binds far more than the flesh.&#10;&#10;This book is said to be utmost authority in such matters, but the copy you have found seems badly damaged and many important passages are missing. Perhaps Boromir of Gondor, who currently rides here in the north, may know something about this book." objectives="The Book of Oaths, page 6&#10;This page includes a scholarly discussion of the gravity of oaths and debates the merits of granting them to personages of differing relationships and ranks.&#10;It particularly stresses the danger inherent in a personage of high station granting an oath to someone of lesser station, for it ties not only the oathgiver by their word, but all of their vassals and subjects as well to the fate of the one to whom that oath is granted –- for good or for ill.&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 8&#10;This section of the book includes a spirited argument between philosophers over the nature of Oaths and the Fate of those who become bound up in them.&#10;On one side of the matter are those who argue that the words and intent of the Oathgiver serve to shape fate itself, tying them irrevocably together in a bond that may guide the actions of those who are part of it in their endeavours –- and similarly hanging as a sword over the Oathgiver, promising a dread fate should that bond be violated.&#10;The other side of the debate includes scholars who reject the notion that mere words shape the world, claiming instead that it is the actions of the Oathgiver that decide the outcome of fate. They argue that the Oath itself simply acts to focus the will or prove the lie of the one who takes it, and that the shame of failure, corruption of the spirit, and the disillusionment of their peers serve more than adequately to turn the tides of fate against the oathbreaker without need of divine providence to punishment.&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 9&#10;This page leads into a discussion at considerable depth of the fate of an ancient Elf who was a Lord among Lords, who set upon himself and his people an Oath so powerful and dire that it is believed to have shaped the course of entire ages of the world, and the fate of countless Elves, Men, and dwarves.&#10;Unfortunately, the argument remains quite abstract within these pages, as the scholars of Men who penned the work seem only to know of these events through legends and myths, and the Elves of that time were apparently not keen to discuss the subject openly.&#10;Nevertheless, if the events described by the scholars are indeed founded even partially in truth, it suggests that the Oath taken by this Elf-lord may well have been the most powerful words ever to pass the lips of any being of Middle-earth, be they mortal or immortal, wizard or king.&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 14&#10;This page wanders into a highly esoteric discussion concerning Oaths and Dragons.&#10;True Dragons are renowned for their power to subtly twist words to their own ends and befuddle the minds of those who are foolish enough to treat with them. The writer attempts to determine whether a creature such as a Dragon could ever truly be bound by an Oath, however granted, or whether they could indeed be bound as such, but would instead use their mastery of lies and deceit to craft an Oath such that the one to whom they granted it would find themselves bound instead.&#10;The arguments, while interesting, eventually become circular and insubstantial as it becomes clear that the writer had little experience in the subject of speaking with Dragons, yet was wise enough not to seek out experimental evidence with which to support his work....&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 17&#10;This page discusses the care with which even the lightest of Oaths must be given. It states that while all Oaths bind, the strength of that bond and the fate that follows may have little to do with the gravity of the words spoken, and a great deal to do with the unforeseen events that then follow.&#10;In particular, the scholar points out the story of a simple and friendly Oath offered at the birthday of a minor noble of the houses of Númenor –- an Oath that in the course of time and events drew his house into a years-long war which served to destroy the fortunes of his family and saw him die a lonely pauper.&#10;Alas, it is impossible to say if the tale was a true one, or a cautionary fable devised by the author to strengthen his argument.&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 19&#10;Many tales speak of the dire consequence of an Oath foolishly given or broken. This page offers a discussion of the strength that may be gained through such bonds when they are wisely taken and followed.&#10;It speaks of a terribly old legend that describes a Man and an Elf-maiden bound in an Oath of love that was so true and so powerful that though in time they found themselves trapped beneath the gaze of the greatest Enemy of that or any other Age, they nonetheless found the means to escape that Evil and flee back into the light of the Sun, stealing away his greatest treasure with them.&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 23&#10;This page describes in detail the Oath of the King on Númenor, taken upon his ascendancy to office. The section goes on into enormous detail concerning how the Oath changed over the course of long dynasties and all the various legal and ceremonial ramifications of those changes.&#10;Despite the wealth of historical knowledge, you find that after reading a few of the minutely printed paragraphs your head begins to ache with the convoluted wording and excessively complex detail, and you fear that you might either nod off, be driven mad, or both should you continue.&#10;The Book of Oaths, page 28&#10;This page stands out from among the rest. The ink it is written in is a strange, messy scrawl, and it delves into a disturbing subject indeed, quite different from the rest of the book.&#10;The writer of this particular section seems obsessed with those spirits which remain in the world of the living long after the time of their own death, and the possible cause of this strange and disturbing undeath.&#10;In some cases at least, such spirits are known to have claimed some unresolved or broken Oath as the bond that holds them in this world beyond their time, and the writer delves into the subject with unbridled curiosity, pondering on what power might make the bond of a man’s Oath so strong as to keep it in the world long beyond its time.&#10;Further passages become more disturbing yet, as it becomes clear that the writer’s fascination with the subject has become unhealthy, as he ponders how servants and slaves might perhaps be made to take Oaths that would bind them in service to their Lords after death.&#10;If the author of this piece ever discovered such a secret, you find with some relief that it is not recorded here.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Candle's Flame is a stirring piece written by one of the great Captains of Gondor during the War of the Last Alliance. It speaks of the very personal connexion that a worthy captain forms with his followers, and the power that bond can have when a fallen warrior lies upon the threshold of Death's door. Few copies of this book exist today, most having been lost in the long years since or secreted away in the hidden libraries of the Lords of Gondor.&#10;&#10;This copy of The Candle's Flame is missing many important pages. Rumour tells that Boromir, a Captain of Gondor, has come north. Perhaps he can help you comprehend the broken knowledge of this book." objectives="The Candle's Flame, page 4&#10;This page details a little about the life of the author, who was a captain in the service of Elendil, High-king of all the lands of Middle-earth. The author managed to survive Elendil’s assault against Barad-dûr and became a great leader in the hosts of Isildur.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 7&#10;This page briefly summarizes the main point of the author’s treatise: That the mark of a true captain is the loyalty and devotion of the men who follow him.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 13&#10;On this page, the author recounts his experiences as a green man-at-arms in Númenor, under the command of a cruel captain in the palace of Ar-Pharazon. The passage clearly demonstrates what a true captain is not.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 16&#10;This page further describes the author’s rise through the ranks of the Guard of Númenor, where he served as a lieutenant to a captain who relied on those under him to manage the ranks. This is yet another example of poor leadership which can break the spirit of fighting men.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 25&#10;This page tells how he was brought into the household of Elendil, the last leader of the Faithful, for the honour and devotion shown him by the men under his command -- shown out of love for a great captain, not out of fear or duty.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 26&#10;This page tells of the author’s acceptance of his new post and his own dedication to the greatest of all mortal captains, Elendil of Númenor.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 31&#10;On this page, the author describes how he was willing to fight and die for his king, and also of his own followers’ like devotion to himself -- a sure sign of his great leadership.&#10;The Candle's Flame, page 35&#10;This page tells that if a captain proves himself great enough to command the undying loyalty of his men, that sometimes it is possible for the voice of the captain to bring those standing upon the threshold of death back to the realm of the living.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting was written about a rather notorious hobbit-burglar mid Third Age, when the Shire was not so secure as it is today. Having found himself drafted into the Shire-muster during a particularly difficult season and pitted against Golfimbul's goblins in a number of pitched battles, he learned to fight in a most ungentlehobbitly fashion that served him well against foes considerably larger and stronger than himself.&#10;&#10;Alas, it has been many years since its writing, and all copies of this interesting text were thought lost, until now. Perhaps the famous hobbit-burglar Bilbo Baggins will have some further insights or thoughts on the book." objectives="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 4&#10;This page outlines a bit of the subject's background -- one Adelbert Took, a close relative of the legendary Bandobras 'Bullroarer' Took. He was apparently something of a trouble-maker without much appreciation of other people's property rights as a young lad, and as such found himself in more than his share of bouts.&#10;The text suggests that this is where the foundation was laid for his eventual accomplishments later in life.&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 5&#10;This page describes the sequence of events that led to Adelbert being pressed into service in the Shire-muster.&#10;It seems that Bandobras Took had become so exasperated with his nephew's behaviour that he personally arranged for the lad to be sent off to the fighting. The text provides a quote from Bullroarer to the effect that the experience would either 'Make him a better Hobbit or kill the young fool off, and either way the rest of us'll be better for it!'&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 7&#10;This page sums up a sequence of letters sent home by Adelbert during the course of his duty in the strife with Gofimbul. To the surprise of all, the lad seemed to have taken to the course of battles and war like a fish to water -- as much as any hobbit could, at any rate. However, he seemed dismissive of the regimentation and orderly nature of the Muster, referring to them as a band of 'useless fops and dandies what hadn't a notion which end of a pike they ought to be on'.&#10;It seems that he then went about forming his own little band of ruffians and skirmishers from among those hobbits of the more aggressive sort that he could convince to join him -- an act of insubordination that surely would have seen him in irons if they had not quickly proven themselves to be among the most proficient scouts and ambushers in the entire force.&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 12&#10;This page recounts the experiences of one of Adelbert's fellow hobbits, wherein he goes into the tactics of traps and ambush that they frequently employed against their goblin adversaries, often striking at the break of day as the goblins would be attempting to find shadowy refuge against the painful light of dawn.&#10;Often they would find the entrance to a cave near a battlefield and wait there concealed, knowing it would be likely that the goblins would attempt to return there as light came back upon the land.&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 15&#10;This page is particularly interesting as it describes the terrible difficulties the diminutive band of hobbit-skirmishers would face when they came upon particularly deadly foes, such as goblin champions during their battles.&#10;It seems that Adelbert himself was the foremost among them in finding the weaknesses of such dangerous adversaries, with a keen understanding of the need to expose them so that his fellows could employ their numbers to overwhelm.&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 19&#10;This page relates some of Adelbert's personal quotes and observations from the field of battle. Of particular note is the degree to which the foes he often faced relied upon intimidation.&#10;He then describes the advantage he often found that he gained when he was able to deal a painful blow against such an enemy -- even if the injury itself was of little consequence, the opponent often became confused as it seemed that the tables had turned in the favour of its opponent, thus providing the opening Adelbert and his fellows needed to fell the creature.&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 24&#10;This page describes Adelbert's fighting style as he taught it to his companions during the campaign. It emphasizes a quick and savage assault, often aimed at the strongest leader or beast among the enemy forces in a bid to both eliminate the most dangerous threat and demoralize the enemy at a single stroke.&#10;The most telling drawback of the method is that the battle will quickly turn against the small assailants if a powerful enemy manages to withstand the attack for more than a few moments, so it entails considerable risk and a readiness to flee swiftly if things do not go their way.&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 28&#10;This final page speaks of the Battle of Greenfields wherein Brandobras Took himself struck off the head of Golfimbul in a single blow. It seems that Adelbert was also involved in this battle, fighting some ways distant from his uncle during the fray and acquitting himself admirably. Adelbert was sorely injured in the battle and was some months recovering in the comfort of the Shire afterwards.&#10;Alas, it seems that all the trials faced and lessons learned did surprisingly little to cure the notable character flaws of the miscreant, but he nevertheless became one of Brandobras' favourites in the years that followed and was generally put up with as an errant but likable fellow.">

<deed key="The_Final_Word" name="The Final Word" type="CLASS" class="Guardian" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;This book is of Elvish origin, having been written so long ago that few of the Elves today were alive at the time of its writing. You cannot even guess at how old it actually is, as it seems to show few signs of age or decay. You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.&#10;&#10;It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past. Perhaps someone in Rivendell will be able to help decipher the book." objectives="The Final Word, Page 6&#10;Like several others, this section is written mainly in Elven prose of an ancient form, making it devilishly difficult to comprehend. You manage to make out several passages that refer to the Oaths of service or fealty that the Elf-guardians of old would make to their charges and lords before embarking into danger.&#10;It seems that they believed such Oaths formed an important foundation for their strength in battle, and they would never enter into them lightly.&#10;The Final Word, Page 7&#10;Another page of nearly indecipherable and ancient prose, it describes battle between two enemies as something other than a simple melee.&#10;Instead, the text describes battles between powerful foes as a form of ritual or dance (your translation here is uncertain) -- one that forms the basis for a bond between the two combatants that transcends the physical.&#10;You begin to suspect that the author was of a decidedly mystical outlook.&#10;The Final Word, Page 13&#10;Sticking to indescipherable prose, the author speaks of the greater tide of battle, wherein many foes stand across from each other hurling insult and threat before inevitably breaking upon each other. This aspect, too, he considers the foundation of a greater bond, both between the fellow warriors of each army, and between the two forces themselves as they steel themselves for battle.&#10;You remain unclear on the nature of this bond the author keeps referring to, but it is clearly the central theme of the work.&#10;The Final Word, Page 14&#10;This page is one of the few written in plain language, though the ancient tongue makes it difficult nevertheless.&#10;It speaks of more mundane subjects than some of the others, such as the crucial role of the guardian in maintaining control over the pace of battle, never allowing it to run away from them and become that portrait of meaningless chaos and noise that presages defeat.&#10;The Final Word, Page 19&#10;Another of the few pages that forego prose for plain language, this speaks to the strength of the guardian's defence, and the manner in which it permits them to find their way to the pulsing heart of the battle, a vantage from which one may express the greatest degree of control over the ebb and flow of the enemy's motion and morale.&#10;The Final Word, Page 21&#10;This page is written in prose so flowery and intricate that after the toils of translating the ancient text you are left with no idea what point the author was trying to make.&#10;Hopefully it is not crucial to the book's secrets or the author would have spoken more plainly?&#10;The Final Word, Page 24&#10;This poem describes that moment in which a great warrior finds himself standing at the heart of the maelstrom -- that place in time and space where the course of the battle almost seems to be suspended like a great thunderhead, moments before the storm breaks. A sense of dread fate falls upon the warrior's shoulders, knowing that the next decision made will resonate with the fate of the world and describe much that is to come.&#10;The Final Word, Page 27&#10;The final page tells of a word -- or perhaps a will made manifest by the heart of the warrior as they stand among their foes and allies alike. Both Oath and Challenge, the form of the word itself is second to its purpose and moment, which the warrior may use to bind all those who face him to his own fate irrevocably.&#10;The author's point is clear. You find yourself wondering whether he purposes to say that there is truly a spiritual force to this word, or whether it is simply a call to the burning hatred of your enemies that in such a time and place they cannot refuse it.">

Few such places pose so great a challenge as the stretch of the Misty Mountains surrounding the region of the High Pass, which is fraught with hazards - both natural and otherwise - to test the most rugged individuals." objectives="Find Cirith Daur 23.3S/3.4E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Cirith Daur was once one of the major passes that travellers used to enter the High Pass. Even at the best of times, it is torn by winds and storms and is treacherous to pass through. It often becomes completely impassable during the late seasons, blocking all access between communities on the eastern and western sides of the Misty Mountains.&#10;Find The Black Crack 20.3S/5.4E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;This small cave in the rocks of the High Pass offers apparent shelter for travellers in times of storm, but it was long ago discovered to be a concealed entrance into the burrows of Goblin-town below, from which goblins would emerge in the dark of night to kidnap those foolish enough to make a camp here. These days the crack sees little use as few even attempt the crossing any more, and the goblins more frequently emerge through the larger gate down below as they make ominous preparations for war.&#10;Find Dómstoll 22.0S/8.6E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Dómstoll -- more often called the Giant’s Throne in Westron –- is a great seat of massive stones that sits above the abandoned ruins of Starkhath and offers a domineering view of the surrounding region when it is not obscured by driving snow and mist. Most of the giants left this place long ago, but rumours say that one, at least, still remains to watch over this lonely domain.&#10;Find Erforgh Cleft 29.6S/9.1E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;The Erforgh Cleft is a massive jumble of rocks and frozen streams left behind by some great mass of ice in ages past. Now it offers some semblance of shelter from the most brutal mountain winds to a nomadic tribe of Gauredain who have made their home here. Whether the Gauredain came here of their own accord or were directed here by the Enemy is uncertain, but their presence is troubling nonetheless.&#10;Find Writhenbores 26.6S/9.0E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;This complex of caves called the Writhenbores seems to be formed by a great mass of boulders, larger than even the giants could hope to lift. How they came to be this way is a mystery -– perhaps by the fall of an entire peak upon the mountainside below or some equally cataclysmic event. The caves are oddly warmer than the wind-stripped slopes outside, possibly heated by a warm spring welling up from deep below the mountain. However, any traveller hoping to take shelter within would be strongly advised to look elsewhere, for this same warmth has drawn a large and deadly brood of worms into these caves, and to carelessly wander within is certain death.&#10;Find Starkhath 20.9S/8.0E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;A group of travellers who passed this way many years ago described a place where giants capriciously tossed boulders across the pass for sport and amusement. The giants appear to be gone now -– some say they were driven away when a new Great Goblin took the throne of Goblin-town and relations between the two races became intolerable. In time, tired of being tormented by their diminutive foes, the giants left this place and moved towards Iorbar to the south-west. Only the massive stone slabs that they once used as shelter remain, echoing with the howls of the Wargs who now prowl among them.&#10;Find Hrimbarg 24.3S/6.9E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Founded before the city of Helegrod. Hrimbarg was once called 'The Crown of the Misty Mountains' by dwarves who lived there, and they marked it as the highest dwelling of their people in all the world at that time. Alas, it fell neither to goblins nor giants nor dragons or other wickedness –- but tales say it fell to a great storm that drove down upon the High Pass and did not relent for five long years, choking the passes with vast mountains of ice, even burying Hrimbarg itself beneath a deep, featureless blanket of snow. When at last the storm relented and their fellows from Moria came north to relieve their brothers at Hrimbarg, not one dwarf was found alive, all having frozen or starved during the long years of isolation. It was decided thereafter that Hrimbarg should not be resettled, and it has stood empty for years beyond reckoning.&#10;Find Akûltot 21.5S/4.5E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Newly built since the ascension of the new Great Goblin of Goblin-town, the camp of Akûltot is set among rock ledges and spires that overlook the approach to the main gates of Goblin-town. Historically, the goblins of the Misty Mountains have eschewed the construction of camps in the inhospitable drifts and glaring light of the High Pass, and it is unsettling that they should choose to do so now. The only likely explanation is that they are preparing to extend their grasp beyond the mountains in some fashion, which is surely ill news to those who live in the hills and forests below.">

Few records remain to describe these caverns, though scholars presume that it was somewhere within that Durin's Bane lay slumbering for uncounted years before the Dwarves delved and awoke its wrath.

The dwarves of old long shunned these caverns out of a sense of foreboding and lingering darkness that could never be fully dispelled by lantern or torch, but when rich veins of mithril were discovered within, these concerns were set aside, and the dwarves began to dig in earnest at the very roots of the mountain.&#10;Find Dalgum-ru 13.7S/101.W (Foundations of Stone)&#10;The caverns of Dalgum-ru have never been safe. Even in Durin's day, miners who entered these twisted passages would sometimes disappear without trace, and rarely would an expedition pass through without reporting strange shadows moving just beyond the light of torches, but never clearly seen.">

<deed key="The_Furthest_Charge" name="The Furthest Charge" type="CLASS" class="Hunter" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Furthest Charge was written by a Captain of Gondor who fought in a misguided battle shortly before the War of the Last Alliance. In this battle, the forces of the young kingdom of Gondor found themselves pitted against a company of Elven hunters out of Lórien, both sides having been tricked into battle by a device of the Enemy, who was determined to cripple the alliance that would eventually result in his overthrow. In this book, the Captain describes a valiant but doomed charge of the Men of Gondor against the Elves, within which they suffered a terrible onslaught of arrows raining down from the sky in such fashion as to cause brave men to cower and falter in their advance, trapped unmoving beneath an endless hail of biting wood and metal.&#10;&#10;The Furthest Charge is considered to be a defining work on the power of the hunter's art in the grand battles that have defined the face of Middle-earth today. Unfortunately, this copy is badly damaged by time and wear. Perhaps Legolas of Mirkwood, purported to be in Eriador, could shed some light upon the text." objectives="The Furthest Charge, page 7&#10;This page is written in the clear hand of a man well-learned in both letters and war. It describes the Order of Battle of the regiment in which he served during the War of the Last Alliance.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 9&#10;This page leads a section of the book describing the early phases of the war, before the Alliance of Elves and Men was fully founded and suspicion was yet rife between the two sides, even as the true threat of Mordor began to reveal itself. This regiment had long been posted in the north to guard the river Anduin as it entered the realm of Gondor -- it is there that the contrivances of the Enemy brought them into unexpected battle with an expedition of Elven warriors come far south out of Lórien.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 10&#10;This page describes the contrivance of the Enemy that triggered the ill-fated battle between the forces of Gondor and Lórien. At that time, the forces of Gondor had in their employ men of wild nature whom they paid to bring them news from lands beyond their border, such as the Eastern Marches of Rohan and the Wilderlands.&#10;They had in part forgotten that they must always be wary of the Enemy's ability to corrupt the hearts of Men, for these untrustworthy scouts brought tidings of a foreign force that had come down the river from the North, armed and armoured in the ways of war and unannounced by any herald -- for those heralds had been slain by dark shadows that crept in the night, unbeknownst to either army.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 14&#10;The battle began on a mist-enshrouded morning, as the valiant men of Gondor fell upon the vanguard of the 'invading' host, sowing confusion and panic among the unsuspecting Elves. But the regiment was doubly betrayed, for the quisling servants of the Enemy had lied as well about the size of the Elvish force that had come from the North, and as the main body of their army crested a nearby hill, the Men of Gondor were greatly dismayed, for it was thrice the size they had been told and near equal in number to their own force.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 17&#10;Thinking that the worst of fates had come to pass -- that the Elves had somehow thrown in their lot with the forces of the Enemy and so brought the moment of utter defeat and ruin fast upon them -- the Men of Gondor dared not shrink from their foes in the midst of battle, lest all hope of victory be lost in a moment of hesitation.&#10;Their Captains rallied the men amongst the remnants of the shattered Elf-vanguard and bade them prepare to charge against the Elves, hoping to rout them from the field of battle with the ferocity of their momentum., knowing that prowess and armour would ensure the victory of their immortal foes should the tide of battle turn for even a moment.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 18&#10;The page follows a florid description of the great blaze of trumpets and the snapping of banners in the rapidly clearing morning, as the sun rose higher upon the field, and the regiment sprang into thunderous motion up the hill.&#10;The captain then describes his own puzzlement as he watched the archers of the Elf-host begin their response, hurling their arrows not at them, but up into the sky, the motion of each archer seeming almost lazy and indifferent to the onrushing army, but each one moving with a strict and rapid precision that belied their careless aim.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 21&#10;This page describes a bedlam of frightened men and horses as arrows rained down among them, a seemingly endless hail of shafts biting armour, flesh, and ground alike with callous indifference. The captain relates that it was not the deadly accuracy of the arrows that inspired fear and chaos, but their random intensity, such that no man upon the field might feel safe or protected for even a moment whether he carried shield or stood in the shadow of his fellow, and so many faltered and stopped, laying about in vain for cover where there was none to be found.&#10;The indifferent rain continued until all was chaos and disorder, and few were those valiant souls who made their way to the Elf-host, there to die upon sword and pike wielded with ruthless efficiency.&#10;The Furthest Charge, page 24&#10;The captain's last entry describes matters that followed the battle, after the Elves took him and those few others who survived their injuries upon the field captive, and in a short while untangled the deception of the Enemy, for it had been his purpose that the battle should not be so decisive, or that the Men of the West should emerge victorious over the forces of Lórien and so unravel the nascent Alliance -- but the Elves having come to little harm in the battle, were thus inclined to be lenient and instead directed their anger even more hotly towards Barad-dûr.&#10;The captain closes by pondering the irony of his regiment's defeat. Had they acquitted themselves with greater valour and cunning upon the field of battle that day...what then would have befallen the Kingdom of Gondor, or indeed all of Middle-earth in the war that followed? Small comfort for so many friends lost, but such are the whims of fate and war.">

Many of these great carvings have been damaged by time and wear, though luckily the bridge that spans this space remains intact, even if somewhat perilous.&#10;Find Gazatmur 7.6S/111.3W (Great Delving)&#10;The grand plaza Gazatmur was once the heart of the Great Delving, surrounded by some of the most prestigious institutions and finest architecture within Khazad-dûm. Now it has been overrun by a large goblin encampment that prevents the dwarves from regaining control of the Delving.&#10;Find Shemeldurj 7.3S/114.8W (Great Delving)&#10;Shemeldurj was an unusual estate constructed by an eccentric but famous architect of the late Second Age. In a departure from classical dwarf-design, it features fanciful spans and buttresses that challenge the observer to seak around each turn and corner to discover where next it goes. Much of it lies in ruins, spoiled by time and th ravaging hands of goblins.&#10;Find the Palace of Náin 6.9S/113.0W (Great Delving)&#10;After the fall of Durin, terror grasped the dwarves of Moria, now seized by panic and fear. Good Nain took his father's place and strove to quell the menace that threatened his halls, wishing to restore peace to his brethren. His short reign was a valiant one, but he too fell to the Bane of Khazad-dûm.">

Once there was fair trade along this route between the dwarf-realms of the mountains and the Elves of Rivendell, but the dwarves were driven out long ago by goblins, and many other hazards have returned to make travel up through this region difficult indeed. For the most part, the Elves keep watch over Cirith Imladris, and few pass beyond its upper reaches into the Misty Mountains.&#10;Find Whitcleft 23.3S/0.2E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;The difficult yet unassuming pass of Whitcleft turned out to be the downfall of one of the larger dwarf-realms within the northern reaches of the Misty Mountains. Believing that the goblins to the north would resolutely struggle to find or dig secret tunnels into their well-defended mines to attack, the dwarves to the sout neglected the defence of this pass.&#10;A particularly cunning goblin chieftain led a horde of his people through the pass of Whitcleft in the deep of winter, forcing them to dig their way through at a terrible cost in lives -- but using this approach he came upon the dwarves from the surface unexpectedly and trapped them underground through the long months that followed, driving most to their death through starvation or futile attempts to escape the siege.&#10;So many goblins froze during the siege that they too were decimated by it, but Durin's Folk were never able to return to their lost stronghold.&#10;Find Rakhâs-bizar 26.6S/2.6E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Rakhâs-bizar has never been well-travelled by the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. For time immemorial, giants have lived in the peaks and valleys to the south, and only those rare few who might call them friends, or who wish to test their mettle against a truly powerful and capricious foe might nave reason to travel there.

The memories of the Dúnedain are long, and their respect for the dead borders on obsession at times.&#10;Use The Ancient Inscription 30.2S/49.1W (Bree-land)&#10;The runes you found seemed to be very old indeed, and in style of ancient Arnorian script that few would readily recognize in these times. While you made out only a little of it, the inscription is likely an oath of fealty taken by Dúnedain to their lords.&#10;&#10;The Men of those days put great store in ceremony and oaths, and believed that to break one would bring a terrible curse upon the oathbreaker.&#10;&#10;Few Men put much store in ritual and ceremony these days -- save for the Rangers of the North, who are rumoured to have descended from those very Dúnedain who once ruled Arnor. Perhaps they are the ones who have protected the inscription from the wear of time?&#10;Use The Ancient Cairn 27.1S/46.6W (Archet)&#10;The cairn is rather unlike many that the Men of old built, but you recalled a tale of an old battle...&#10;&#10;In the time after the fall of Arnor and the defeat of Angmar by the host of Gondor, few men remained in the north. Those who remained loyal to the old kings banded together under the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain and became the forebears of the Rangers who walk these lands today, or so it is rumoured.&#10;&#10;In those days there were still evil Men and worse who walked these lands and there was a battle few Men alive today remember. Though the Dúnedain were victorious, their numbers dwindled. The cairn you have found is most likely the resting place of the men who died in that battle, built hurriedly and in secret.&#10;Use The Ancient Crest 30.7S/52.6W (Bree-town)&#10;You found a carving with an old Arnorian symbol upon it. It appeared to be the crest of the ancient kingdom of Arthedain.&#10;&#10;The ruins of that kingdom stretch for miles to the south-west and north. Bree-town itself was built upon a crossroads between Arthedain and its sister kingdom Cardolan to the east. Once they were all one great kingdom, stretching all across the north, but the folly of Men first sundered them, then set them against each other until one after another they fell over the long years of the Third Age.&#10;&#10;There are some folk who still remember the tales of Arthedain, but you suspect that the crest may be of particular importance to the Rangers, for it is said that they are descended from that bloodline.&#10;Use The Ancient Altar 31.2S/44.9W (Bree-land)&#10;The strange altar you found appeared to be Arnorian in origin, with signs that some gathering or ritual had taken place there recently.&#10;&#10;You've heard rumours that Rangers here in the north occasionally gather for a ceremony to declare the coming of age of one of their number, where they induct the young man or woman into their ranks by way of an oath to the old kingdoms.&#10;Use The Ancient Obelisk 29.5S/45.8W (Bree-land)&#10;You found an old obelisk out among the Arnorian ruins, seemingly newer than the ruins themselves, with the names of many Men carved upon it. Your only guess is that it must be some sort of memorial.&#10;&#10;The design and the style of the names you saw there suggest that it was built by the Dúnedain, and given their reverence for their ancestors there is every reason to believe that it may be a memorial for their fallen.&#10;&#10;Some of the names seemed to have been added recently, suggesting that the Rangers are somehow involved...">

<deed key="The_Joy_of_Battle" name="The Joy of Battle" type="CLASS" class="Champion" minimumLevel="39" description="The Joy of Battle is an aptly named text, written by a great dwarf-champion during the height of Durin's reign in Khazad-dûm. It is no simple treatise on the art of battle, as so many texts are. Rather, it is a philosophical tract that describes the author's outlook upon warfare and battle, and how he came eventually to seek it out as a meditative and even transcendent experience that he was unable to experience in any other setting save the midst of clashing blades and cries of battle. It is not a text for the faint-hearted or the meek, but it seems oddly lofty and its tone does not reflect the maddened bloodlust that one might have expected given the title.&#10;&#10;Alas, the long years have been rough on your copy and there are a number of pages missing from it. Gimli the Dwarf might have some insight into the missing knowledge of The Joy of Battle, since it was written by one of his forebears in the depths of time." objectives="The Joy of Battle, Page 11&#10;This page, belonging about a third of the way into The Joy of Battle, begins in the middle of an account of a great battle between the dwarves of Khazad-dûm and the Goblins of the Misty Mountains. Among the tales are some account of the author's own courageous deeds.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 14&#10;This page of the author's encounter with the chief of the goblin invaders. The the battle had raged for many hours and his strength was flagging, he was able to muster his strength in the defence of his fellows.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 18&#10;In this text, the author exhorts the reader not to become so carried away in battle that he does not recognize danger posed to his allies, but rather to allow the excitement and energy generated by the thrill of battle to strengthen his arms against all threats, to himself and to his allies.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 24&#10;This page begins a series of meditations the author went through while preparing for battle. Amounting more to rallying speeches and self-praise than deep meditations, he used these to enervate himself.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 25&#10;This page continue's the author's battle meditations, though the writing begins to scrawl a little as though he were becoming wrapped up in his own diatribe.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 28&#10;This page sounds almost like a joyous and bloodthirsty rant. The author either lost focus or was intentionally trying to get the reader's heart pounding.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 32&#10;The tone of this page is much more subdued than previous pages. The author explains the importance of fervent resolve and idealism to a champion's inner strength.&#10;The Joy of Battle, Page 36&#10;This page wraps up the text with an overview of all that came before. Though there are some pages damaged beyond recall, a reader of this book may still take from it the heart of the author's teachings.">

<deed key="The_Rising_Chord" name="The Rising Chord" type="CLASS" class="Minstrel" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Rising Chord is considered to be a remarkable collection of songs all of a theme that speaks to the heart of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in one voice, be they Men, Elves, or dwarves. Drawing on the tradition of each of these peoples, the songs resound with a clarion call of freedom and hope that is unsullied by the slightest trace of sorrow, fear, or hate. There are some who claim that this work is shallow and without dimension, but to the adept minstrel, it is a description of form unparalleled by other works. Unfortunately, the book and its strident forms became 'unfashionable' after the fall of the North Kingdom, as a deep lethargy and cynicism crept over the kingdoms of Men, and the Elves withdrew ever further into their forest strongholds.&#10;&#10;'Nowadays, The Rising Chord is quite difficult to find, and even when a copy is found -- such as this -- it is incomplete at best. Perhaps the famed Elvish minstrel Lindir might be able to tell you more about it." objectives="The Rising Chord, page 3&#10;This page details a classical Dúnedain song from the times when Arnor still stood proudly in the North, extoling the strength and vigour of that lost kingdom.&#10;Given the rather maudlin praises of the distant past that they seem to prefer in this day and age, the song offers a striking example of how a people's music may change over the passage of years to reflect the condition and times within which they live. It also hints at the strength and heights to which they might again aspire....&#10;The Rising Chord, page 4&#10;Recorded in a particularly ancient form of Sindarin, this song purports to be an Elvish work in praise of the light of Elbereth's stars, written in a timeless age before the Sun and the Moon hung in the sky.&#10;It is a remarkably simple song, containing few of the more complex contrivances of form that can often be found in Elvish music. Even so, the story of the song's origin sounds more like some tale out of myth than you are ready to give credence to.&#10;The Rising Chord, page 11&#10;This spry piece seems to hail from the Shire. It purports to be a local harvest-song from around the Michel Delving area, sung by many of the farmers and youths there as they move through the fields in late summer and fall. The lyrics speak of the fine meals they would enjoy in their comfortable holes during the long, cold winter months that follow.&#10;The Rising Chord, page 14&#10;This song was written by a talented singer amongst the Rohirrim and speaks simply and clearly of the love he held for a young woman among his own people.&#10;Unlike so many love songs, it does not dwell on the sorrow of parting, nor unrequited love, nor jealousy, nor hardship of any sort. It speaks solely of her beauty in his eyes, and the joy that comes to those lovers who learn to truly understand each other.&#10;The Rising Chord, page 16&#10;Technically speaking, this song is a dwarf-dirge sung for the fallen upon the field of battle, though it is not clear which of the dwarf-houses is hails from.&#10;The song's relationship to a dirge is distant at best, as it turns the sombre tones of the form on their head with the inclusion of bawdy, irreverent lyrics intended to unreservedly celebrate both the life and death of the fallen hero. Indeed, you have never seen so brash and overt a challenge to the sullen and infinite power of death as this song proposes.&#10;The Rising Chord, page 23&#10;This song is a victory march from Gondor, written to celebrate the grand victory of the Last Alliance over the forces of darkness and the fall of Sauron. It was written before Isildur's untimely death, and in the context of the events that followed, it has gained an undertone of sombre irony.&#10;Regardless, it also clearly declares the strength and power of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth to rise up against seemingly unconquerable adversity.&#10;The Rising Chord, page 27&#10;Though sometimes it seems that the immortal span of the Elves results in a preponderance of art that breathtakingly mourns times and places lost beyond the memory of any mortal race, there are also those that speak of the vitality of the endless present, describing the experience of those Elves who do not care to dwell on the events of ages past.&#10;This song is one of the latter, rooted firmly in the experience of living in a vital world that obligingly continues to change, offering an unlimited palette of new experiences to anyone who cares to open their eyes to the world that surrounds them in the here and now.&#10;The Rising Chord, page 28&#10;This song speaks only to the wonder and palette of the natural world, without acknowledgement of axe, nor fire, but only the passage of seasons, the growth of trees, and the wandering of animals who guard no purpose beyond the day at hand.&#10;At first, you suppose that it might be an Elvish song, but on further reflection the forms do not reflect that heritage of music. In fact, you find it difficult to determine who might have written such a piece, for it does not adhere to the principles common to any of the Free Peoples -- and it is certainly no work of Orc of Dragon -- but the mystery only adds to its cachet as a unique and vibrant work of art.">

Standing on the outskirts of Hobbiton proper it can be seen for quite some ways, and during festivities it is often hung with dozens of bright streamers and lanterns providing a cheery atmosphere for most any event.&#10;Find Methel-stage 32.5S/69.9W (Shire)&#10;It is said that when Bilbo Baggins returned from his wanderings abroad, he came back with a good deal more wealth than he had before he left.&#10;&#10;While rumors abound to the source and improper nature of his riches, among the works he built within the Shire was the Methel-stage upon which Hobbits of an artistic leaning are invited to perform and entertain their fellows during festive occasions.&#10;&#10;Of course, Bilbo disappeared again recently - bringing up all the old rumours of his improper adventures and such - but many of the folk of the Shire nevertheless continue to appreciate the causes to which he put his money.&#10;Find Stocktower 33.0S/63.6W (Shire)&#10;The Stocktower is a curious old Arnorian ruin standing guard near the Brandywine Bridge.&#10;&#10;Few such ruins still stand in the Shire - having long ago been dismantled by industrious Hobbits to construct more modern residences, but the Stocktower has become something of an icon and mischievous Hobbit children have been known to frequent the ruin despite their parents' admonishments to the contrary.&#10;Find The Quarry 27.9S/65.7W (Shire)&#10;For a long time Dwarves were not seen with much frequency in the Shire, and bringing stone from far abroad was expensive, so the Hobbits constructed their own quarry to supply the needs of builders and masons.&#10;&#10;Recently however, better quality stone has been available from the west, so the quarry has fallen into disuse and has become infested with dangerous vermin.&#10;Find Bridgefields Wall 30.5S/64.1W (Shire)&#10;Bridgefields Wall is one of the few remaining signs of the ancient kingdom of Arnor within the bounds of the Shire.&#10;&#10;Farmer Puddifoot has been threatening to pull it down for years now to build walls for his own fields, but some of the richer hobbit families of Michel Delving have prevented him from doing so in the Shire councils, demanding that the wall is preserved for historical purposes. So it stands there still.&#10;Find The Great Willow 33.6S/70.4W (Shire)&#10;While not as well known as the Party Tree, the Great Willow is considered a great deal more mysterious and romantic by the younger Hobbits of the Shire.&#10;&#10;Folk tales abound of Elves travelling into the West who spend their evenings in mysterious revels beneath its boughs, and young Hobbit couples often come here to declare their romantic intentions, perhaps hoping a bit of fairy magic might give them luck and bravery enough to say the words.">

The servants of Sauron assail this last bastion of the Free Peoples, and the Dark Lord turns his greatest strength upon the south-kingdom.&#10;Complete Book 2: The Dawnless Day&#10;You crossed through the expanse of central Gondor and came to the port city of Pelargir, where you faced Balakhôr the Scourge and ended the threat of Umbar.&#10;Complete Book 3: Voices of the Past&#10;Following the defeat of the Corsairs at Pelargir, Aragorn entrusted you with the mission of keeping secret his capture of their ships and his plan to sail up the Anduin to the aid of Minas Tirith. You went by another road to Osgiliath, now held by the enemy, and sabotaged the great war machine Grond. It was there that you encountered a foe you thought had been dispatched: Mordirith, once Steward of Angmar, eternal slave of the Witch-king. He had been wrested from the Void and sent back in a new guise, and as the wraith Gothmog he commands many of the forces of Mordor.&#10;Complete Book 4: Siege of the White City&#10;You arrived at the great city of Minas Tirith with little time to spare, as the forces of the Enemy encircle the White City and prepare to mount their siege. From a secret chamber in the Tower of Ecthelion, Steward Denethor wrestled against the despair of Sauron in the depths of the Anor-stone. If no allies come, and soon, the doom of which he speaks must surely fall upon Minas Tirith.&#10;Complete Book 5: The Ride of the Rohirrim&#10;With the aid of the Woses you found the Riders of Rohan and joined their charge to the field of Pelennor. The battle is joined, and the fate of Gondor hangs in the balance.&#10;Complete Book 6: The Battle of the Pelennor Fields&#10;The armies of Gondor and Mordor clashed on the fields of the Pelennor, and you stood with your friends against the ravening Morgul hordes. The cost of victory was high. Many heroes will not return to their homes to see the peace their lives have brought.&#10;Complete Book 7: The Trap&#10;Aragorn has undertaken a dangerous mission: he marches to the Black Gate of Mordor with an army too small to wage serious war against the forces of Sauron. And yet, the Host of the West occupies every thought of the Dark Lord, for he is consumed with fear that Aragorn has obtained the Ring of Power and seeks to install himself as sovereign.&#10;Complete Book 8: The Black Gate&#10;Aragorn's dangerous scheme to draw the eye of the Dark Lord has borne fruit. But it brings an upsetting revelation: Sauron has captured a Hobbit within Mordor. And his Dark messenger displays tokens of proof: Bilbo's mail-shirt, Sam's short sword, and an Elf-cloak of Lórien. The Quest of the Ring has failed. The Host of the West fights on, but the circle in which it stands draws ever smaller as the end approaches . . .&#10;Complete Book 9: The Ring of the Power&#10;And so it was that the Quest of the Ring came to a successful conclusion, and Sauron was destroyed. In the end, it was not through feat of strength or prowess in combat that the Dark Lord was undone, but by the courage and fortitude of two hobbits, and the mercy they showed to another: Sméagol of the river-folk. He it was who destroyed the Ring and ended the dominion of Sauron.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Treatise of Valour was written by a council of captains who once commanded the great fortresses of the ancient kingdom of Arnor during the height of its power. It was said to have been the foundation stone of the principles of leadership and warfare for the warriors of Arnor and offered knowledge and teaching that proved key to staving off the assaults of Angmar for so long as the North Kingdom stood. All the remaining copies of the Treatise were believed lost or burned in the Sack of Fornost.&#10;&#10;Many pages of this book, The Treatise of Valour, have been torn or burned, rendering the volume nearly unreadable. Perhaps Boromir of Gondor, recently come north, will know something about it." objectives="Treatise of Valour, page 2&#10;This page is part of the introduction and tells somewhat of the authors. The council which wrote the book comprised of some of the greatest tactical minds of Arnor, and their skill in defensive tactics saved many a life, though in the end, they failed.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 3&#10;This first section was written by a captain skilled in fisticuffs. He describes various methods by which to defend oneself from harm whilst unarmed.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 5&#10;This section was written by a captain who was known for his great skill in armed combat. His techniques of armed defence would be enlightening to even the greatest swordsmen of the current day.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 10&#10;This chapter was written by a captain who was most concerned with the threat of fire and boiling oil often encountered during siege warfare. He outlines the use of shield-walls and other strategies to resist the effects of fire.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 12&#10;This section was written by a captain who specialized in tactics involving harsh weather. His knowledge of ways to protect against bitter cold and driving rain can keep soldiers alive in the field.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 15&#10;This page was written by a captain with an exceptional understanding of the weapons of Orcs and goblins, particularly the poisons they use. Any warrior wishing to know how to defend against poisoned blades would be wise to read this chapter in its entirety.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 18&#10;This chapter was written by Isildur, King of Arnor, himself. It speaks of dark magic ad the ways by which it brings doom to the spirit. He tells how to defend oneself against its ravages, for he himself faced the terror of the Dark Lord Sauron and was victorious.&#10;Treatise of Valour, page 22&#10;This last page summarizes all that came before it, and also admonishes the reader to remember one thing above all else: The greatest captains are true to those who serve them and unswervingly loyal to their lords.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Gondolin of old was home to the most legendary Marchwardens of the Elder Days. This tome is an account told by a scribe of those brave Elf-warriors during the long wars against Morgoth. Much of it is a heroic epic, told in linnod-verse, describing multiple forays from the great city into the realms of the Enemy. As with all tales of those times, however, it soon becomes a tragedy; one by one the Wardens were lost, many slain, and some were taken and broken in the dungeons of Morgoth. Many of the tactics passed down to the Wardens of today began with this book, which ends suddenly with the tragic fall of the great city." objectives="The Watch Against the Night, page 5&#10;This painting, though faded in colour, clearly depicts the grace and power of a Marchwarden on the field of battle.&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 7&#10;The writing here appears to have been scribed while the author was watching the Wardens train; it tells much of the tactical skills of the Marchwardens of old.&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 13&#10;On this page is a silverpoint portrait of a fair scene: Marchwardens at the gate of their city, fell but fair, cold and yet full of mirth. Such is the changeling nature of a true Warden.&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 17&#10;This poem sings of the mightiest and doughtiest of the Marchwardens of Gondolin, of his great deeds and sorrows in his long years in Beleriand.&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 21&#10;Sorrowful thoughts come to mind: struggle, strife, and impregnable gloom, as these words are read: 'Edhel erthad. Galadrim. Golodh. Tawarwaith. girith mór uireb.' Would darkness prevail, even if all the sundered Elves would but unite?&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 25&#10;This page tells of a young Elf who rashly marched into battle though untrained as a Warden. He was lost, taken by the servants of Morgoth and slaughtered before the eyes of his brethren. They could not aid him, not until it was too late.&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 41&#10;This page is blank but for a word at the top: 'Estel'. Sindarin for 'trust'. As the word is spoken aloud with noble intentions in mind, a map appears in silvered lines. The secret layout of Gondolin is revealed.&#10;The Watch Against the Night, page 44&#10;'Etherio e teleth...hi bein Gondolin luithio...alna no echain'. These words, though unknown to you, fill your mind with visions of a fair city, but your heart is pricked by a piercing grief, as if something you loved but knew not was about to be lost to you forever.">

It may once have served as the entrance to an ancient store-house.&#10;Find The Chamber of Dark Waters 16.9S/111.9W (The Water-works)&#10;This ancient store-house may once have held materials needed to maintain the great mechanisms of the Water-works of Khazad-dûm. Now it lies quiet, filled with still, black water that does not appear to have been stirred by any living thing for years.&#10;Find The Lost Treasury 17.3S/111.0W (The Water-works)&#10;The surviving records of Khazad-dûm mark this old storehouse as a treasury. Perhaps this building once overflowed with dwarf-gold and jewels, but that was long ago, before the Orcs came and stole it all away as tribute for the Dark Lord of Mordor.&#10;Find Narag-kheleb 17.2S/114.7W (The Water-works)&#10;Next to this great pillar, in the ceiling far, far above, one can make out an ancient shaft that seems to lead to the upper levels of Moria. Whatever use the dwarves had for it, it seem that the goblins have since taken to using it as a place to hurl their refuse.&#10;Find Harâzgund 17.6S/116.9W (The Water-works)&#10;The gateway of Harâzgund leads to the source of one of the greatest ducts in all of Khazad-dûm. It once supplied water to nearly half of all the dwarves who lived beneath these mountains, but it was broken by some unknown calamity during the long, dark years after the fall of Durin. Now the water lies here unmoving, flooding the deeps in great, stagnant pools.&#10;Find The Chamber of Memory 18.2S/111.6W (The Water-works)&#10;Dwarf-scholars believe that the Chamber of Memory was so named because it held a great repository of books and scrolls, storing many of the more mundane records of Khazad-dûm. If it indeed ever held such records, they have either been stolen away or were destroyed when the Water-works flooded after the kingdom's fall.">

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;You have heard of this book before -- The Way of the Hunter is believed to have been a work produced by Elven hunters who were set to the task of guarding the approaches of the hidden city of Gondolin, which fell to the forces of darkness in the First Age. While this work outlived its authors and has been copied innumerable times since, many of those copies were produced by Men from far older works and are imperfect in their translation, leaving several important points untold.&#10;&#10;This copy of The War of the Hunter appears to have been a much more accurate work, probably transcribed by Elven scribes in Rivendell or Lórien -- but unfortunately someone seems to intentionally defaced the book, ripping several pages from it. Legolas of the Elves might be able to shed some light on the text." objectives="The Way of the Hunter, page 1&#10;This is the title page of The Way of the Hunter. It does confirm that the text was translated by a lore-master in Rivendell.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 3&#10;This page from the preface speaks of the purpose of the book, which is to aid those who choose the path of the hunter to maximize the efficiency of their skills, but it says little to actually do so.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 4&#10;The author smoothly transitions into a discussion of tracking and survival skills. There is much here that a student of the hunter's path could benefit from.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 8&#10;This page discusses the proper use of a bow from a perch. Precarious balance can lead to many missed shots.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 17&#10;This page outlines the best use of the bow while on the move. Rarely does an arrow fly true when loosed in motion, even from the bow of an Elf, but these techniques may help minimize wayward quarrels.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 20&#10;This page describes the organization of the forwards scouts of Gondolin in the days before the Goblin Wars. Their tactical knowledge may be of use to the intelligent hunter, though not without the remainder of the book.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 21&#10;This page helps explain the information found in previous notes, though without all of the previous notes it has little meaning.&#10;The Way of the Hunter, page 28&#10;This page concludes The Way of the Hunter, summarizing the goals, but saying little about the actual text. It is useless outside of the full book.">

<deed key="Thunder_and_Flame" name="Thunder and Flame" type="CLASS" class="Rune-keeper" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Thunder and Flame was scribed by a Rune-keeper of ancient Khazad-dûm, known to have been an advisor to King Durin himself. It is said that this ancient tome held many secrets of the Angerthas, passed down from the earliest days in the First Age. It speaks at length of the subtleties of the Cirth script, and how to draw forth the powers of the elements: of fire and storm and winter's chill, for use against one's enemies.&#10;&#10;In the end, however, even this vastly complex might was not enough to sate the greed of the dwarves, nor prevent the destruction wrought upon Moria by the awakening of the ancient evil that slumbered in the deep." objectives="Thunder and Flame, page 3&#10;This page is covered with tiny yet beautiful Runic scrawl, listing several rare symbols and their inherent meanings. Days upon days would be needed to absorb all that was written, or to fully perceive the potency of each letter.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 8&#10;The content of this particular page would bore any but the most dedicated Rune-keeper, for it is thick with technical language. Any who will attend such material with interest will undoubtedly find many secrets waiting to be disentangled from its subtle lore.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 12&#10;The author reveals in this text some very ancient word-wrapped manoeuvres meant to invoke the most powerful mastery of every accessible element. To behold his performance of these incantations must have been a breathtaking spectacle.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 19&#10;This page displays a skilful illustration of an ancient Rune-keeper's proper ceremonial garb, all in richly coloured ink. The pigment has perhaps faded over time, but the impact of the drawing remains intact.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 23&#10;The text here tells of the heart of the true Rune-keeper, desiring balance and harmony above actual mastery of the elements employed by his skill.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 26&#10;Here reads the tale of the author's life, how he rose from meagre beginnings to become among the most learned in the subtle artistry of language and runes. His rise to mastery was a long and arduous journey, and his learning spanned the course of his lifetime.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 34&#10;Upon this page is a list of ideal Rune-stones, their shape and weight, and which material best pairs with which manner of Rune-speech. Certain stones seem to tell the master its own preference, rather than the master choosing at his own will, or so it would seem.&#10;Thunder and Flame, page 42&#10;This page gives a brief history of how the Rune-keepers came into being: of their origin, of the inspirations that formed them, and of compelling deeds done by the most influential Rune-keepers throughout the long ages of Middle-earth.">

Eärendur was the tenth and last of the Kings of Arnor - after his death the kingdom of Arnor was divided by his contending sons into the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. It was during this period that the capital was moved to Fornost, and the old city of Annúminas was finally abandoned after declining in importance for many years.&#10;Find Haudh Elendur 16.3S/66.0W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Elendur, son of Valandur. As the ninth king of Arnor, Elendur had one of the longest and most enduring reigns of all, ruling over the people of Arnor for one hundred and twenty five years.&#10;Find Haudh Valandur 16.4S/66.5W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Valandur, son of Tarondor. History mentions relatively little about the eighth king of Arnor, except that he is said to have died in violent and mysterious circumstances sometime around the 50th year of his reign - a foreboding sign perhaps, of the strife that was to fall upon the Northern Kingdoms in the years to come.&#10;Find Haudh Elendil 16.7S/67.0W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Elendil, son of Amandil. Elendil was the first and founding King of Arnor, whither he had fled into Middle-Earth from the great ruin of Númenor. Elendil fought alongside Gil-galad as the leader of the Last Alliance and died during the Siege of Barad-Dûr at the hands of Sauron. After his death Elendil was secretly interred at Halifirien far to the south, but some of his most important standards and personal effects were symbolically placed within the tomb at Annúminas in his stead.&#10;Find Haudh Tarondor 16.9S/66.1W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Tarondor, son of Tarcil. The reign of the seventh king of Arnor was marked by a time of comparative peace, for the strife that would consume and in time destroy the Kingdoms of the North had not yet arisen.&#10;Find Haudh Eldacar 17.2S/66.8W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Eldacar, son of Valandil. Eldacar ruled as the fourth king of Arnor, and was the direct grandson of Isildur himself. It is believed that Eldacar ruled during a time of peace that extended from the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance at his grandfather's hand, but most of the records of this time in Arnor have been destroyed.&#10;Find Haudh Tarcil 17.1S/66.0W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Tarcil, son of Arantar. Tarcil was the sixth king of Arnor and his reign lasted for about eighty years before the crown passed to his son, Tarondor.&#10;Find Haudh Arantar 17.2S/66.3W (Evendim)&#10;The tomb of Arantar, son of Eldacar. Though the reign of the fifth King of Arnor was said to last for nearly a century, most of the records of this time were lost in the eventual fall of the Northern Kingdoms, and little is now known of his rule.">

<deed key="Valour%27s_Marches" name="Valour's Marches" type="CLASS" class="Minstrel" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Valour's Marches -- the very title of the book you hold stirs something within your breast as you look upon it. Though its cover crumbles with age, the binding remains strong, as if infused with the same martial fervour that the melodies within it strive to invoke. This book is one of the rare few that survived the fall of the kingdom of Númenor, coming across the waves by some unlikely circumstance to Middle-earth, where it has lain hidden for ages. Though written in the Sindarin tongue, the songs are those of the noble kingdoms of Men. Nevertheless, they speak to the heart of any who would face battle, calling forth visions of endless, shining hosts on the march, thundering with the clash of steel in a thousand voices.&#10;&#10;In the hands of a minstrel, these songs of martial eminence provide crucial insight into the working of the warrior's heart and how it might be aroused from its slumber in times of need. If only so many of the songs were not frustratingly missing from the volume you now hold. Perhaps Lindir of Rivendell may be able to help fill the voids." objectives="Valour's Marches, page 1&#10;The first song is an old Númenorean rower's song meant to lift the spirits of soldiers bent hard at the oar and to prevent fatigue before impending battle at sea. It called upon the winds to offer speed, the morning mists to confound their enemies, and the waves to hurl them ashore lest they founder in the deeps.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 5&#10;This ancient music was a ceremonial march played for soldiers who had returned from across the sea, to celebrate their safe homecoming after duties far from the shores of the Isle of Númenor.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 7&#10;This stirring but mournful march was supposedly played to commemorate the deaths of lesser nobles and dignitaries of the ancient kingdom of Númenor.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 8&#10;This unique piece was supposedly played in the royal court of Númenor to unmistakably announce the victory of the King whenever a conquered leader was brought before his throne. It was played in that court for the last time when the Enemy was brought before the King in chains, having surrendered before the might of Númenor's armies.&#10;After the fall of Númenor it came to be said that to play this march was to invite disaster and defeat in any military endeavour.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 12&#10;This drum-dominated score is a truly classical example of a military march. Played by the soldiers of Númenor as they marched victoriously across the ancient lands of Middle-earth, it was one of the most recognizable pieces of music in its day.&#10;Many variations of this score exist today, but the original was thought lost in the long turmoil following the sudden fall of that mighty kingdom.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 16&#10;This drum score is considered very unusual for the period of the Númenoreans. Minstrels and scholars suppose that its writer may have been influenced by contact with the musical culture of the Haradrim, far off in the uncharted South of Middle-earth.&#10;Such was the scope and power of Númenor at its height that even those distant kingdoms knew war and trade with the Men of Westernesse.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 23&#10;Though penned by a minstrel of Númenor, this song is written in Sindarin and shows numerous influences from the Elven culture of music.&#10;This piece likely arose during the earlier span of Númenor's long reign before the Men of Westernesse mostly turned away from their appreciation of things Elvish, and a deep estrangement formed between the their peoples.&#10;Valour's Marches, page 26&#10;This song was an anthem written to celebrate the unlimited might and majesty of the Last King of Númenor as he embarked at the head of a vast expeditionary fleet. It speaks of a vast fleet numbering in the thousands and of the ascension of the King to godhood as he proudly sailed into the West.&#10;The song ends half-finished -- clearly the minstrel had left it incomplete in expectation of describing the victorious return of the fleet with its god-king, but never got the chance to do so.">

It is now occupied by part of the dwarf expedition to retake Moria from the orcs and goblins.&#10;Find The Hall of the High Stair 4.7S/112.0W (Durin's Way)&#10;These stairs lead to the upper halls of Durin's Way. They were likely built before the larger road to the west was completed, and the room in which they were constructed may have been part of the original course Durin charted through Moria as he explored its depths.&#10;Find Gloku-ru 4.1S/111.2W (Durin's Way)&#10;These ruined workshops and dwellings once housed a family of dwarves who were famous for their skill in crafting wondrous toys in intricate designs of wood and metal. Such simple joys were lost long ago when darkness fell upon Khazad-dûm, and the Orcs came.&#10;Find Ninknakh Faltor 3.6S/112.9W (Durin's Way)&#10;Whatever its original purpose was, a large host of goblins has made its residence in the hall of Ninknakh Faltor. Their dark shrines and crude constructions litter the area, and their sheer numbers pose a serious threat to any hopes of retaking Durin's Way.&#10;Find Tharâkh Bazân 3.6S/109.2W (Durin's Way)&#10;Tharakh Bazan is a most unusual wonder to find beneath the roots of a mountain. It is more commonly known as 'Durin's Garden,' for Durin himself ordered it built so that any dwarf might come here and be reminded of the wider, sun-lit world beyond the bounds of Moria. Clever constructs of polished metal and crystal guide light down from far above to grant life here, beneath the mountain. It seems that the evil things that now infest Moria likewise find the light uncomfortable, for among all the works of the dwarves, Tharakh Bazan remains relatively unmarred by their ravages.&#10;Find Salab Nurjundul 3.6S/107.5W (Durin's Way)&#10;Salab Nurjundul was once one of the busiest intersections in all of Moria, and each day hundreds if not thousands of dwarves would pass through here going about their lives and business. Now it is desolate and empty, offering only a dangerous gauntlet for would-be explorers to pass through with constant threat of ambush by the evil denizens who befoul the once-beautiful workshops and residences nearby.&#10;Find Uflûmp-mur 3.0S/110.5W (Durin's Way)&#10;These chambers once acted as the gatehouse of the Endless Stair. It is from here that one might once have made the ascent up thousands of steps to the heights of Zirakzigil above and thereupon mounted the Tower of Durin, and from there look out upon the wide world below with an eye rivaling that of the Eagles themselves. Now orcs act as the wardens of this place, and they are loathe to allow any to pass uncontested.">

As far as anyone else is concerned, it’s a grim pile of stone with a commanding overlook of the valleys that wind below, providing an excellent vantage for its inhabitants to bowl great rocks upon whatever interlopers are foolish enough to wander this far into the Mountains.&#10;Find Greybough End 31.4S/3.4E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Whatever explorer gave Greybough End its name must have been desperately homesick and thinking of greener lands and happier times. Despite the name, there is nothing whatsoever comforting about massive granite slabs piled here like children's blocks. The fact that it serves as lair to massive brutes who constructed it only adds to the irony of its comfortingly familiar name.&#10;Find Giant's Needle 30.4S/3.6E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;The Giant's Needle is simply a massive stone spire erected by the Giants of the Misty Mountains. No purpose has ever been found for it, nor is its construction all that remarkable given the size of its builders. What is perhaps most remarkable about the Giant's Spire is that none of the giants has ever gotten around to knocking it down just for fun. It is this that leads scholars to believe that it does indeed have some meaning or purpose, but even the wise cannot guess at what that might be.&#10;Find Iorbar 30.6S/5.7E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Iorbar is a massive, desolate settlement within which the Giants of the Misty Mountains gather from time to time. While Iorbar is not a fortress in any true sense of the word, its sheer size and great stone structures make it a formidable redoubt, and its massive inhabitants make it even more so. Even at height of their strength within the Misty Mountains, Durin's Folk never made open war against the giants, nor attempted to drive them from Iorbar despite the occasional raids and harassment of travellers; instead, an uneasy truce reigned for many long years until the dwarves were finally driven out of the mountains by goblins.&#10;Find Gabilazan 28.0S/0.8E (The Misty Mountains)&#10;Gabilazan was one of the two fortresses built by Durin's Folk in the northern reaches of the Misty Mountains, beneath which stretched extensive mines. Alas, these settlements were always challenged by the goblins which infested the range. After the fall of Helegrod to the north to a marauding Dragon and its spawn, Gabilazan was eventually isolated, besieged and overrun by goblins during the waning rule of the Longbeards. These days the goblins have abandoned the fortress to ruin and in their stead an odd alliance of giants and the traitorous Dourhands have made it their home.">

<deed key="Whispers_in_the_Dark" name="Whispers in the Dark" type="CLASS" class="Rune-keeper" minimumLevel="39" description="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;'Whispers in the Dark', one of the strangest books ever written, was actually penned by a Rune-keeper of the race of Man, not an Elf or dwarf. He hailed from Rhudaur not long before its fall in the war between Arnor and the forces of the Witch-king. Its pages discuss the powers of the class no Man has ever been able to follow, much less master. The writing is mad, scribbled in wild, uneven runes in a disorganized manner upon stained pages, many of which are loose leaves simply stuffed into the book. The writer was driven to madness by seeking the secrets of Rune-craft, but rumour has it that great and terrible discoveries were recorded in this text. The book's spine is cracked and weak, and only the first half of its pages cling, yellowed and fragile, to this withered binding. Elrond would yearn to know what the lost pages contain." objectives="Whispers in the Dark, page 3&#10;The author covered this page entirely with black ink save for the hair-thin lines which inscribe some runes in the middle of the sheet. Simply holding this page causes the hairs on the back of your neck to stand on end: something fey is expressed in these letters.&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 8&#10;On this leaf are sketched some diagrams of hands in strange poses. Perhaps they are hand signals meant to mimic the runes inscribed along the side of the paper. Surely these signals could do nothing to enhance a Rune-keeper's skill...or could they?&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 13&#10;The runes here are undoubtedly written in blood, probably the author's. The page itself is inexplicably disturbing to look at. Filling your heart with cowering dread. You want nothing more than to quickly bestow this page to its proper place with Elrond and be rid of it forever: you have learned enough from this one.&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 15&#10;You squint at this page for a long time even though it is blank, but only when you close your eyes do you see clear letters burned into the dark behind your eyelids.&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 18&#10;When you read the runes scrawled all over this sheet, you think that you hear whispers by your ear. You turn this way and that to find the source of the sound, but find that you are quite alone. The whispers fade when you stow the page away.&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 25&#10;Here the author writes as in a diary of the fall of Rhudaur as it unfolded before him and the unraveling of his mind as he pursued the meaning of runes while his world crumbled around him. It seems to be among the more lucid moments recorded in this tome.&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 32&#10;This page is utterly crammed with tiny scribbling notes of failed attempts at symbol-mastery, but there seem to be a small handful of combinations that worked, and these are circled in some unpleasantly coloured ink.&#10;Whispers in the Dark, page 39&#10;This fascinating page is a journal of when the author decided Rune-keeping was a worthwhile pursuit, laying out his goals and inspirations. His mind was not yet broken when these words were laid down.">

It lies well off the beaten path and has an abundance of local wildlife - but there is also little recourse or chance of rescue for any hunter unfortunate enough to be injured while travelling so far afield.&#10;Find The Even-rills 3.7S/69.5W (Evendim)&#10;The Even-rills are a series of connected pools and falls fed by ice melting high in the mountains north of Lake Evendim.

While there is little truth to most of these fanciful tales, there is certainly an aura of strange enchantment about the secluded grove called the Eavespires.&#10;Find The Eave-mere 5.8S/72.8W (Evendim)&#10;The Eave-mere represents the lower stretch of the largest tributary to Lake Evendim. Fed by rapids from higher up the mountain and crashing down in great falls towards the lake below, the mere itself is a calm and placid place that was said to be much admired by travellers seeking quiet solace in the old days of Annúminas before the city was abandoned and many of the further shores of Evendim were reclaimed by the wilds.&#10;Find Swiftbrook 7.0S/74.5W (Evendim)&#10;This cold and isolated stream cuts deeply through the rock of the mountains high above the western side of Lake Evendim before descending through the tumultuous rapids to the Eave-mere below and thence to Lake Evendim itself. Legends speak of a beautiful maiden who - distraught over the abandonment of her ancestral home and the encroachment of the wilds upon the once glorious city of Annúminas - came here and threw herself into the waters from the high walls of the chasm above. Alas, even the old stories do not guess at the truth of this tale, or whom the woman might have been.&#10;Find The Twisted Grove 11.5S/75.1W (Evendim)&#10;The Twisted Grove is a dark and foreboding place, set in the deepest wilds west of Lake Evendim. Even during the reign of the Kings of Arnor, it was considered an unlucky place and was avoided by most. Now it seems certain that an unwholesome power is at work here, and the very trees seem to radiate a malice towards living things that intrude upon their dark solitude.&#10;Find Rushingdale 13.7S/75.8W (Evendim)&#10;Though visited infrequently even in the time of Arnor, the pool now known as the Rushingdale was held in reverence by the local people who would leave offerings floating upon the edge of the waters. Despite the roar of the nearby falls, a sense of uplifting calm does seem to settle upon your spirit as you gaze into the shifting reflections in the water here.">

Fine woods, wine and foodstuffs would be exchanged for gold, priceless gems and finely wrought pieces of smith-craft. Anything at all could be bought or sold within this very hall, though it is hard to imagine to look upon it now.&#10;Find Mudmul-charâf 6.4S/108.5W (Zelem-melek)&#10;Founded as the dwarves expanded east from the halls of Old Moria to the west, the terraces of Mudmul-charâf once housed many a fine dwarf-craftsman -- rather, at least, among those wealthy enough to live but a few halls from the throne of Durin himself.&#10;Find Hall of Flowing Water 9.1S/107.7W (Zelem-melek)&#10;Water has ever been an important aspect of dwarf-artistry, as hidden rivers and lakes are among the most vital features of any settlement beneath the hills and mountains. The Hall of Flowing Water is a fine example of this artistry, and it has remained surprisingly intact after so many years untended.&#10;Find Gabil-mamach 9.0S/107.2W (Zelem-melek)&#10;The original purpose of the Chamber of Gabil-mamach cannot be found in the old texts and histories of Moria. The simple span that crosses this room does not seem to serve any vital purpose, and the wise might argue whether it is symbolic in nature, or whether something of import was once contained in the space below.&#10;Find Chamber of Mazarbul 4.8S/105.3W (Zelem-melek)&#10;It is likely that the Chamber of Mazarbul once served some great ceremonial purpose in the old days of Moria; now it remains the tomb of Balin, son of Fundin and friend to old Bilbo, who, not so many years ago, led an expedition much like the current one to retake Moria and restore it to the glories of old. Alas that his efforts came to ruin so final that none ever returned to their homes to tell the tale of it, and only now has the truth been learned.&#10;Find Gabil-hul 9.7S/108.7W (Zelem-melek)&#10;Here at Gabil-hul once stood a dam constructed to capture the waters that flow through this area and so supply water to the dwarves inhabiting Zelem-melek. Now it lies in shattered ruins among stagnant puddles.&#10;Find The Great Hall of Durin 7.8S/106.1W (Zelem-melek)&#10;Within this grand hall stood the throne of Durin the Deathless, first and greatest father of the dwarves. Though the first Durin lived a life far beyond the span of any other, he did in time pass away, but always another took up his name and ruled on as Durin. The dwarves claim that these rulers are each Durin himself, returned to them from the stone time and again to sit upon the throne of Moria and watch over them, until at last he fell before the power of Durin's Bane, leaving the throne empty, perhaps forever.&#10;Find Uzbad-bakân 10.5S/107.9W (Zelem-melek)&#10;The shattered plaza of Uzbad-bakân likely hosted the shops of dwarf-merchants once, long ago. Now it lies mostly silent and strewn with rubble, broken only by the occasional echoing snarl of an Orc.">
